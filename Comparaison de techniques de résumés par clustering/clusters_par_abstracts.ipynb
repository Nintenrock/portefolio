      "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces HIV acquisition risk by >90% and is a critical lever to reduce HIV incidence. Identifying individuals most likely to benefit from PrEP and retaining them on PrEP throughout HIV risk is critical to realize PrEP's prevention potential. Individuals with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are an obvious priority PrEP population, but there are no data from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) confirming the effectiveness of integrating PrEP into STI clinics. Assisted partner notification may further enhance STI clinic-based PrEP programming by recruiting PrEP users from the pool of named sexual partners of individuals presenting with an incident STI. However, the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of these integrated and enhanced strategies are unknown.\n",
      "This study aims to describe the implementation outcomes of acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness (regarding PrEP uptake and persistence) of integrating an enhanced PrEP implementation strategy into an STI clinic in Malawi.\n",
      "The enhanced PrEP STI study is a prospective cohort study enrolling patients who are eligible for PrEP (aged ≥15 years) who are seeking STI services at a Lilongwe-based STI clinic. Data collection relies on a combination of in-depth interviews, patient and clinic staff surveys, and clinic record review. All enrolled PrEP users will be screened for acute HIV infection and receive quarterly testing for Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis, and syphilis. Participants will be asked to name recent sexual partners for assisted notification; returning partners will be screened for PrEP eligibility and, if interested, enrolled into the cohort of PrEP initiators. We will also enroll patients who are eligible for PrEP but choose not to initiate it, from the STI clinic. Patient participants will be followed for 6 months; we will assess self-reported PrEP use, PrEP refills, sexual behaviors, perceived HIV risk, and incident STIs. Clinic staff participants will be interviewed at baseline and at approximately 6 months and will complete surveys examining the perceived acceptability and feasibility of the integrated and enhanced PrEP strategy.\n",
      "Enrollment began in March 2022 and is projected to continue until February 2023, with patient participant follow-up through August 2023. The results of this study are expected to be reported in 2024.\n",
      "This study will generate important evidence regarding the potential integration of PrEP services into STI clinics in SSA and preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of an enhanced intervention that includes assisted partner notification as a strategy to identify potential PrEP users. Furthermore, this trial will provide some of the first insights into STI incidence among PrEP users recruited from an STI clinic in SSA-critical data to inform the use of etiologic STI testing where syndromic management is the current standard. These findings will help to design future PrEP implementation strategies in SSA.\n",

      "Multi-assay algorithms (MAAs) are used to estimate population-level HIV incidence and identify individuals with recent infection. Many MAAs use low viral load (VL) as a biomarker for long-term infection. This could impact incidence estimates in settings with high rates of early HIV treatment initiation. We evaluated the performance of two MAAs that do not include VL.\n",
      "Samples were collected from 219 seroconverters (infected < 1 year) and 4376 non-seroconverters (infected > 1 year) in the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial; 28.8% of seroconverter samples and 73.2% of non-seroconverter samples had VLs ≤ 400 copies/mL. Samples were tested with the Limiting Antigen Avidity assay (LAg) and JHU BioRad-Avidity assays. Antibody reactivity to two HIV peptides was measured using the MSD U-PLEX assay. Two MAAs were evaluated that do not include VL: a MAA that includes the LAg-Avidity assay and BioRad-Avidity assay (LAg + BR) and a MAA that includes the LAg-Avidity assay and two peptide biomarkers (LAg + PepPair). Performance of these MAAs was compared to a widely used MAA that includes LAg and VL (LAg + VL).\n",
      "The incidence estimate for LAg + VL (1.29%, 95% CI: 0.97-1.62) was close to the observed longitudinal incidence (1.34% 95% CI: 1.17-1.53). The incidence estimates for the other two MAAs were higher (LAg + BR: 2.56%, 95% CI 2.01-3.11; LAg + PepPair: 2.84%, 95% CI: 1.36-4.32). LAg + BR and LAg + PepPair also misclassified more individuals infected > 2 years as recently infected than LAg + VL (1.2% [42/3483 and 1.5% [51/3483], respectively, vs. 0.2% [6/3483]). LAg + BR classified more seroconverters as recently infected than LAg + VL or LAg + PepPair (80 vs. 58 and 50, respectively) and identified ~ 25% of virally suppressed seroconverters as recently infected.\n",
      "The LAg + VL MAA produced a cross-sectional incidence estimate that was closer to the longitudinal estimate than two MAAs that did not include VL. The LAg + BR MAA classified the greatest number of individual seroconverters as recently infected but had a higher false recent rate.\n",
      "Blood donations in South Africa are tested for HIV RNA using individual donation NAT (ID-NAT), allowing detection and rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) of acute HIV infections. We enrolled a cohort of acute and recent HIV-infected blood donation candidates in South Africa in 2015-2018, measured HIV antibody, ID-NAT, and recency of infection &lt;195 days (Sedia LAg) at enrollment and initiated early ART. A small cohort of HIV elite controllers was followed without treatment. HIV reservoir measurements included ultrasensitive plasma RNA, cell-associated HIV RNA, and total DNA. Enrollment of 18 Fiebig I-III and 45 Fiebig IV-VI HIV clade C subjects occurred a median of 18 days after index blood donation. ART was administered successfully and compliance with follow-up visits was excellent. There were only minimal differences in HIV reservoir between ART initiation in Fiebig stages I-III vs. IV-VI, but ART noncompliance increased HIV reservoir. In 11 untreated HIV elite controllers, HIV reservoir levels were similar to or higher than those seen in our early treated cohort. National blood services can identify acute HIV cohorts for subsequent HIV cure research studies. Among HIV clade C-infected donors, HIV reservoir differed little by Fiebig stage at treatment initiation, but was smaller than in chronically treated HIV and those with ART noncompliance.\n",
      "Information on treatment failure (TF) in People living with HIV in a data-poor setting is necessary to counter the epidemic of TF with first-line combined antiretroviral therapies (cART) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this study, we examined the risk factors associated with TF in Asmara, Eritrea from 2001 to 2020.\n",
      "A multicenter, retrospective 1:2 matched (by age and gender) case-control study was conducted in four major hospitals in Asmara, Eritrea on adults aged ≥ 18 years who were on treatment for at least 6 months. Cases were patients who fulfills at least one of the WHO therapy failure criterion during the study period. Controls were randomly selected patients on first-line treatment and plasma viral load < 1000 copies/ml in their latest follow-up measurement. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for TF. All P-values were 2-sided and the level of significance was set at P < 0.05 for all analyses.\n",
      "Of the 1068 participants (356 cases; 712 controls), 585 (54.7%) were females. The median age at treatment initiation was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 39-51]. Median time to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) failure was 37 months (IQR = 24-47). In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with increased likelihood of TF included initial nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) backbone (Zidovudine + Lamivudine (AZT + 3TC): adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.70, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.65-4.41, P-value < 0.001), (Abacavir + lamivudine (ABC + 3TC): aOR = 4.73, 95%CI: 1.18-18.92, P-value = 0.028], and (Stavudine + Lamivudine (D4T + 3TC): aOR = 5.00; 95% CI: 3.03-8.20, P-value < 0.001) in comparison to Emtricitabine and Tenofovir diproxil fumarate (FTC + TDF). Additional associations included prior exposure to cART (aOR = 2.28, 95%CI: 1.35-3.86; P- value = 0.002), record of sub-optimal drug adherence (aOR = 3.08, 95%CI: 2.22-4.28; P < 0.001), ambulatory/bedridden at presentation (aOR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.12-4.28; P-value = 0.010), presence of comorbidities (aOR = 2.37; 95%CI: 1.36-4.10, P-value = 0.002), duration of cART (< 5 years: aOR: 5.90; 95% CI: 3.95-8.73, P-value < 0.001), and use of SMX-TMP prophylaxis (aOR = 2.00, 95%CI, 1.44-2.78, P-value < 0.001).\n",

      "Post-partum loss to follow-up and lack of early HIV infant diagnosis (EID) can significantly affect the efficiency of programs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.\n",
      "In a prospective observational study 167 women were enrolled at week 36 of gestation and followed with their infants up to one year after delivery. Retention was defined as the proportion of women who attended the 12 months visit and EID as an HIV PCR test performed within 2 months. Determinants for retention and EID were assessed in univariate analyses and in multivariable logistic regression models.\n",
      "Women lost to follow-up (24/167 or 14.4%) had a shorter duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) at enrolment in comparison to women retained in care (\n",
      "Longer duration of ART at enrolment significantly predicted a better post-partum retention, suggesting that specific counselling interventions should be targeted to recent ART initiators. A low proportion of infants did not receive an EID, but predictive factors were difficult to identify.\n",
      "We describe tuberculosis (TB) disease among antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligible children living with HIV (CLHIV) in South Africa to highlight TB prevention opportunities.\n",
      "In our secondary analysis among 0- to 12-year-old ART-eligible CLHIV in five Eastern Cape Province health facilities from 2012 to 2015, prevalent TB occurred 90 days before or after enrollment; incident TB occurred &gt;90 days after enrollment. Characteristics associated with TB were assessed using logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression with generalized estimating equations.\n",
      "Of 397 enrolled children, 114 (28.7%) had prevalent TB. Higher-income proxy [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.6] for the highest, 1.6 (95% CI 1.6-1.7) for intermediate]; CD4+ cell count &lt;350 cells/µl [aOR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.2)]; and malnutrition [aOR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.6)] were associated with prevalent TB. Incident TB was 5.2 per 100 person-years and was associated with delayed ART initiation [hazard ratio (HR) 4.7 (95% CI 2.3-9.4)], malnutrition [HR 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.7)] and absence of cotrimoxazole [HR 2.3 (95% CI 1.0-4.9)]. Among 362 children with data, 8.6% received TB preventive treatment.\n",

      "We describe tuberculosis (TB) in children living with HIV (CLHIV) eligible for HIV treatment in South Africa to highlight opportunities to prevent TB.\n",
      "We analyzed additional data from our original study of CLHIV who were 0–12 years old and due to start HIV treatment in five health facilities in Eastern Cape Province from 2012 to 2015 and assessed characteristics associated with existing and new TB.\n",
      "Of 397 enrolled children, 114 (28.7%) had existing TB. Children with a higher measure of household income had higher odds of existing TB. CD4+ cell count &lt;350 cells/µl and malnutrition were also associated with existing TB. There were 5.2 new cases of TB for every 100 child-years. New TB was 4.7 times more likely for children with delayed HIV treatment start, 1.8 times more likely for children with malnutrition and 2.3 times more likely for children who did not get cotrimoxazole. Among 362 children with data, 8.6% received treatment to prevent TB.\n",

      "Detection of acute and prevalent HIV infection using point-of-care nucleic acid amplification testing (POC-NAAT) among outpatients with symptoms compatible with acute HIV is critical to HIV prevention, but it is not clear if it is cost-effective compared with existing HIV testing strategies.\n",
      "We developed and parametrised a decision tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of (1) provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) using rapid tests, the standard of care; (2) scaled-up provider-initiated testing and counselling (SU-PITC) in which all patients were tested with rapid tests unless they opted out; and (3) opt-out testing and counselling using POC-NAAT, which detects both acute and prevalent infection. The model-based analysis used data from the Tambua Mapema Plus randomised controlled trial of a POC-NAAT intervention in Kenya, supplemented with results from a stochastic, agent-based network model of HIV-1 transmission and data from published literature. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Kenyan government using a primary outcome of cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted over a 10-year time horizon.\n",
      "After analysing the decision-analytical model, the average per patient cost of POC-NAAT was $214.9 compared with $173.6 for SU-PITC and $47.3 for PITC. The mean DALYs accumulated per patient for POC-NAAT were 0.160 compared with 0.176 for SU-PITC and 0.214 for PITC. In the incremental analysis, SU-PITC was eliminated due to extended dominance, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing POC-NAAT to PITC was $3098 per DALY averted. The ICER was sensitive to disability weights for HIV/AIDS and the costs of antiretroviral therapy.\n",
      "POC-NAAT offered to adult outpatients in Kenya who present for care with symptoms compatible with AHI is cost-effective and should be considered for inclusion as the standard of HIV testing in this population.\n",

      "To study the structure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 drug resistance (DR) in patients with newly diagnosed infection. Residents of the Republic of Guinea (N = 2168) were tested for HIV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Individuals with a positive result were further examined for the presence of viral load in blood plasma. HIV was analyzed using Sanger sequencing. The obtained sequences were genotyped using REGA (version 3.0) and analyzed in MEGA 7. Analysis for the presence of DR mutations was performed using the Stanford University HIV DR Database. Serological markers of HIV were detected in 239 people, which represents 11.02% of the entire sample. HIV RNA was detected in 58 people. The following subtypes were seen: HIV CRF02_AG (41.9%); A1 (29.1%); A3 (12.9%); URF A1_G (12.9%); and G (3.2%). In 25% of patients, at least one significant mutation was encountered leading directly to HIV DR. The mutations encountered cause resistance to NRTI and NNRTI; one case of multiple resistance was identified. Major resistance to protease inhibitor was not seen. The detection of HIV-1 mutations associated with DR, in individuals who have never received antiretroviral therapy, is a cause for concern. It suggests that: new infections are occurring with strains that already have resistance; and the expansion of resistance is not always directly associated with selective drug pressure. Among the likely reasons for the high prevalence of primary HIV DR in the Republic of Guinea, drug availability is probably the key. The consequence of this is the lack of adherence of patients to treatment, the formation and transmission of resistant variants of the virus in the population. These findings suggest the need to test patients for resistant virus variants before initiating treatment.\n",
      "HIV and AIDS continue to be major public health concerns globally. Despite significant progress in addressing their impact on the general population and achieving epidemic control, there is a need to improve HIV testing, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study applied deep and machine learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the bagging classifier, gradient boosting classifier, support vector machines, and Naïve Bayes classifier to predict HIV status among MSM using the dataset from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. RNNs performed better than the bagging classifier, gradient boosting classifier, support vector machines, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier in predicting HIV status. RNNs recorded a high prediction accuracy of 0.98 as compared to the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier (0.84), bagging classifier (0.91), support vector machine (0.91), and gradient boosting classifier (0.91). In addition, RNNs achieved a high precision of 0.98 for predicting both HIV-positive and -negative cases, a recall of 1.00 for HIV-negative cases and 0.94 for HIV-positive cases, and an F1-score of 0.99 for HIV-negative cases and 0.96 for positive cases. HIV status prediction models can significantly improve early HIV screening and assist healthcare professionals in effectively providing healthcare services to the MSM community. The results show that integrating HIV status prediction models into clinical software systems can complement indicator condition-guided HIV testing strategies and identify individuals that may require healthcare services, particularly for hard-to-reach vulnerable populations like MSM. Future studies are necessary to optimize machine learning models further to integrate them into primary care. The significance of this manuscript is that it presents results from a study population where very little information is available in Zimbabwe due to the criminalization of MSM activities in the country. For this reason, MSM tends to be a hidden sector of the population, frequently harassed and arrested. In almost all communities in Zimbabwe, MSM issues have remained taboo, and stigma exists in all sectors of society.\n",
      "Accessing family planning is a key investment in reducing the broader costs of health care and can reduce a significant proportion of maternal, infant, and childhood deaths. In Ethiopia, use of modern contraceptive methods is still low but it is steadily increasing. Identifying the contributing factors to the changes in contraceptive use among women helps to improve women's contraceptive use and helps to plan strategies for family planning programs. Thus, the current study aimed to analyze the trends and predictors of changes in modern contraceptive use over time among married women in Ethiopia.\n",
      "Secondary data analysis of the national representative data of 2000-2016 Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey was employed.\n",
      "This secondary data analysis was considered using 2000 through 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys. The study used data from the four DHSs conducted in Ethiopia (2000-2016). The data from all EDHS was collated so as to follow the trends throughout the period considered for the survey. Married women aged 15-49 years with sample sizes of 36,721 (9,203 in 2000, 8,438 in 2005, 9,478 in 2011, and 9,602 in 2016) were included. The analysis involved three levels, including trend analysis (to see changes from 2000 to 2005, 2005-2011, 2011-2016 and 2000-2016). Bivariate and multivariate analysis were also considered to identify predictors of modern contraceptive use. Data was extracted from the EDHS datasets for which authorization was obtained from the DHS Program/ICF International using a data extraction tool. SPSS 24 was employed for data management and analysis.\n",
      "Among married women of reproductive age, modern contraceptive prevalence increased from 6.2% in 2000 to 35.2% in 2016. This 5-fold increment in modern contraceptive use was due to being in the age group of 25-29 years (AOR = 1.4; 95%CI (1.1, 1.7)), having two children (AOR = 1.3; 95%CI (1.1, 1.6)), the richest wealth category (AOR = 3.0; 95% CI (2.5, 3.5)), currently working (AOR = 1.3; 95%CI (1.2, 1.5)) and attending secondary and above education (AOR = 1.2; 95%CI (1.1, 1.6)) were found to be predictors.\n",
      "Over the past 15 years, an annual average of a 1.9% point increment has been observed in modern contraceptive use, but the country lags behind the SDGs's 2030 target of achieving zero unmet needs for contraception. Program interventions, and continued education of women, are mandatory, as education is one of the major factors contributing to increasing contraceptive use.\n",
      "The cystine-cystine chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is the primary HIV co-receptor involved in the viral entry process into human cells. The 32 bp deletion variant within the CCR5 gene (CCR5-Δ32) plays a very important role in viral recognition and progression of AIDS.\n",
      "The current study was aimed at evaluating the CCR5-Δ32 gene variation frequency in Nigerian and Zimbabwean populations residing in Northern Cyprus.\n",
      "A total number of 211 subjects (103 Nigerians and 108 Zimbabweans) were analyzed. Nigerian population was further analyzed with respect to the three major ethnicities: Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba. Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine the CCR5-Δ32 gene variant status.\n",
      "All studied subjects from both sampling groups were homozygous for the CCR5 wild type gene (CCR5-wt), meaning neither heterozygous nor homozygous genotypes of CCR5-Δ32 gene variant were observed.\n",
      "This study observed the absence of CCR5-Δ32 deletion gene in the Nigeria and Zimbabwean populations living in Northern Cyprus. These populations lack the genetic advantage over HIV infection and may also show a rapid progression towards AIDS. Additionally, these populations could impact the local gene frequency as these two populations interact more and more.\n",
      "HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) often co-occur. However, less evidence exists on the long-term STI dynamics among persons living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa to inform interventions. We investigated the incidence, prevalence and factors associated with STIs, starting from acute HIV infection in a cohort of South African women.\n",
      "The CAPRISA002 study enrolled women with acute HIV infection and performed STI testing and treatment 1-2 times annually from 2004-2020. We estimated STI incidence, re-infection, and prevalence trends before and after antiretroviral treatment (ART). We fitted Cox regression models to identify factors associated with STIs.\n",
      "We followed up 235 women (median age = 25 years, IQR 22-29) for 7.5 years (IQR 5.7-10.8). New STI and re-infection cases per 100 person-years (PYs) were 5.1 and 9.5 for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), 7.4 and 14.7 for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), 8.0 and 26.6 for Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), 7.7 and 16.7 for Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and 25.2 and 37.3 for any STI. STI incidence, was associated with HIV log<sub>10</sub> viral load (AHR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), active syphilis (AHR = 16.55, 95% CI 7.49-36.55), a positive HSV-2 PCR (AHR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.35), bacterial vaginosis (AHR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.01-2.18), recent regular sexual partners at enrolment (one vs none: AHR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.41-4.87; two plus vs none: AHR = 3.68, 95% CI 1.79-7.59) and age (5-year fold: AHR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92).\n",

      "Testing for 'recent HIV infection' is common in surveillance, where only population-level estimates (of incidence) are reported. Typically, 'recent infection' is a category, obtained by applying a threshold on an underlying continuous biomarker from some laboratory assay(s). Interpreting the biomarker values obtained for individual subjects, as estimates of the date of infection, has obvious potential applications in the context of studies of early infection, and has also for some years attracted significant interest as an extra component of post-test counselling and treatment initiation. The applicable analyses have typically run aground on the complexity of the full biomarker growth model, which is in principle a non-linear mixed-effects model of unknown structure, the fitting of which seems infeasible from realistically obtainable data.\n",
      "It is known that to estimate Mean Duration of Recent Infection (MDRI) at a given value of the recent/non-recent -infection discrimination threshold, one may compress the full biomarker growth model into a relation capturing the probability of a recent test result as a function of time t since infection, given a value of assay threshold h which defines the recent/non-recent discrimination. We demonstrate that the derivative (gradient), with respect to h. of the probability of recent infection, seen as a function of both t and h, is identical to the formal likelihood relevant to Bayesian inference of the time since seroconversion, for a subject yielding an assay result h, at or close to the date of their first positive HIV test. This observation bypasses the need for fitting a complex detailed biomarker growth model. Using publicly available data from the CEPHIA collaboration, we calibrated this likelihood function for the Sedia Lag assay, and performed Bayesian inference on hypothetical infection data.\n",
      "We demonstrate the generation of posteriors for infection date, for patients with various delays between their last negative and first positive HIV test, and a range of LAg assay results (ODn) hypothetically obtained on the date of the first positive result.\n",
      "Depending on the last-negative / first-positive interval, there is a range of ODn values that yields posteriors significantly different from the uniform prior one would be left with based merely on interval censoring. Hence, a LAg ODn obtained on the date of, or soon after, diagnosis contains potentially significant information about infection dating. It seems worth analysing other assays with meaningful dynamic range, especially tests already routinely used in primary HIV diagnosis (for example chemiluminescent assays and reader/cartridge lateral flow tests which admit objective variable line intensity readings) which have a sufficient dynamic range that corresponds to a clinically meaningful range of times-since-infection that are worth distinguishing from each other.\n",
      "Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in early HIV infection is important to limit seeding of the viral reservoir. A number of studies have shown that if ART is commenced prior to seroconversion, the seroconversion may, or may not, occur. We aimed to assess whether seroreversion or no seroconversion occurs using samples collected during an early treatment study in South Africa.\n",
      "We tested 10 longitudinal samples collected over three years from 70 blood donors who initiated ART after detection of acute or early HIV infection during donation screening on fourth- and fifth-generation HIV antibody and RNA assays, and three point of care (POC) rapid tests. Donors were allocated to three treatment groups: (1) very early, (2) early, and (3) later. Longitudinal samples were grouped into time bins post-treatment initiation.\n",
      "On all three high-throughput HIV antibody assays, no clear pattern of declining signal intensity was observed over time after ART initiation in any of the treatment initiation groups and 100% detection was obtained. The Abbott Determine POC assay showed 100% detection at all time points with no seroreversion. However, the Abbott ABON HIV1 and OraSure OraQuick POC assays showed lower proportions of detection in all time bins in the very early treated group, ranging from 50.0% (95% CI: 26.8-73.2%) to 83.1% (95% CI: 64.2-93.0%), and moderate detection rates in the early and later-treated groups.\n",

      "Engaging men in HIV services remains a challenge across sub-Saharan Africa. There is a critical need to better understand facilitators of men's successful engagement with HIV services and assess if there are similarities across contexts. We conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 92 men living with HIV (MLHIV) across Malawi, Uganda, South Africa, and Eswatini, most of whom had been diagnosed with HIV within the last 5 years. We coded interviews for themes using a constant-comparative approach. We contextualized our findings within a socioecological framework. HIV testing was primarily motivated by illness (individual level), though illness was sometimes accompanied by prompting and support from healthcare providers and/or intimate partners. Once diagnosed, nearly all participants reported immediate linkage to care, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and subsequent ART adherence. ART initiation and adherence were facilitated by men's sense of agency and ownership over their health (individual level), social support from intimate partners, friends, and family (interpersonal/network level), supportive-directive counseling from healthcare providers (institutional/health systems level), and male-friendly services, i.e., rapid, respectful, private (institutional/health systems level). Health literacy regarding viral suppression (individual level), strengthened by patient-provider communication (institutional/health systems level), was highest in Uganda, where most men could discuss viral load testing experiences, report their viral load status (most reported suppressed), and demonstrate an understanding of treatment as prevention. Elsewhere, few participants understood what viral load suppression was and even fewer knew their viral load status. Our findings reveal socioecological-level facilitators of men's progress across the HIV-care continuum. Programs may want to leverage facilitators of ART initiation and adherence that span socioecological levels-e.g., healthcare ownership and agency, social support, supportive-directive counseling-and apply them to each end of the continuum to encourage early HIV testing/diagnosis and improve health literacy to help men understand and achieve viral load suppression.\n",
      "HIV/Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-infected individuals have an increased risk of tuberculosis prior to loss of peripheral CD4 T cells, raising the possibility that HIV co-infection leads to CD4 T cell depletion in lung tissue before it is evident in blood. Here, we use rhesus macaques to study the early effects of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) co-infection on pulmonary granulomas. Two weeks after SIV inoculation of Mtb-infected macaques, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells are dramatically depleted from granulomas, before CD4 T cell loss in blood, airways, and lymph nodes, or increases in bacterial loads or radiographic evidence of disease. Spatially, CD4 T cells are preferentially depleted from the granuloma core and cuff relative to B cell-rich regions. Moreover, live imaging of granuloma explants show that intralesional CD4 T cell motility is reduced after SIV co-infection. Thus, granuloma CD4 T cells may be decimated before many co-infected individuals experience the first symptoms of acute HIV infection.\n",
      "Up to 69% of adults who acquire HIV in Kenya seek care before seroconversion, providing an important opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment. The Tambua Mapema Plus (TMP) trial tested a combined HIV-1 nucleic acid testing, linkage, treatment, and partner notification intervention for adults aged 18-39 years with symptoms of acute HIV infection presenting to health facilities in coastal Kenya. We estimated the potential impact of TMP on the Kenyan HIV epidemic.\n",
      "We developed an agent-based network model of HIV-1 transmission using TMP data and Kenyan statistics to estimate potential population-level impact of targeted facility-based testing over 10 years. Three scenarios were modeled: standard care [current use of provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC)], standard HIV rapid testing scaled to higher coverage obtained in TMP (scaled-up PITC), and the TMP intervention.\n",
      "Standard care resulted in 90.7% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) knowing their status, with 67.5% of those diagnosed on treatment. Scaled-up PITC resulted in 94.4% of PLWH knowing their status and 70.4% of those diagnosed on treatment. The TMP intervention achieved 97.5% of PLWH knowing their status and 80.6% of those diagnosed on treatment. The percentage of infections averted was 1.0% (95% simulation intervals: -19.2% to 19.9%) for scaled-up PITC and 9.4% (95% simulation intervals: -8.1% to 24.5%) for TMP.\n",
      "Our study suggests that leveraging new technologies to identify acute HIV infection among symptomatic outpatients is superior to scaled-up PITC in this population, resulting in >95% knowledge of HIV status, and would reduce new HIV infections in Kenya.\n",
      "Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has become a common AIDS-defining cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus strongly modulated by HIV-related immune suppression are the principal causes of this cancer. No other risk factors have been identified as playing a strong role. HIV prevention programs and good coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developed countries resulted in a remarkable decline in HIV-KS incidence and better KS prognosis. By contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, population ART rollout has lagged, but clinical studies have shown positive results in reduction of KS incidence and better KS prognosis. However, the effect of ART rollout in relation to population KS incidence is unclear. We describe the incidence of KS in sub-Saharan Africa, in four time-periods, (1) before 1980 (before HIV/AIDS era); (2) 1981-2000 (early HIV/AIDS era, limited or no ART coverage); (3) 2001-2010 (early ART coverage period); and (4) 2011-2016 (fair to good ART coverage period). We used KS incidence data available from WHO-International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) publications and the Africa Cancer Registry Network. National HIV prevalence and ART coverage data were derived from UNAIDS/WHO. A rapid increase in KS incidence was observed throughout sub-Saharan Africa as the HIV epidemic progressed, reaching peak incidences in Period 2 (pre-ART rollout) of 50.8 in males and 20.3 per 100 000 in females (Zimbabwe, Harare). The overall unweighted average decline in KS incidence between 2000 and 2010 and 2011-2016 was 27%, but this decline was not statistically significant across the region. ART rollout coincides with a decline in KS incidence across several regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of other risk factors such as reductions in HIV incidence could not be ascertained.\n",
      "Transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 envelope proteins (Envs) from infected individuals that developed neutralization breadth are likely to possess inherent features desirable for vaccine immunogen design. To explore this premise, we conducted an immunization study in rhesus macaques (RM) using T/F Env sequences from two human subjects, one of whom developed potent and broad neutralizing antibodies (Z1800M) while the other developed little to no neutralizing antibody responses (R66M) during HIV-1 infection. Using a DNA/MVA/protein immunization protocol, 10 RM were immunized with each T/F Env. Within each T/F Env group, the protein boosts were administered as either monomeric gp120 or stabilized trimeric gp140 protein. All vaccination regimens elicited high titers of antigen-specific IgG, and two animals that received monomeric Z1800M Env gp120 developed autologous neutralizing activity. Using early Env escape variants isolated from subject Z1800M as guides, the serum neutralizing activity of the two immunized RM was found to be dependent on the gp120 V5 region. Interestingly, the exact same residues of V5 were also targeted by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (nmAb) isolated from the subject Z1800M early in infection. Glycan profiling and computational modeling of the Z1800M Env gp120 immunogen provided further evidence that the V5 loop is exposed in this T/F Env and was a dominant feature that drove neutralizing antibody targeting during infection and immunization. An expanded B cell clonotype was isolated from one of the neutralization-positive RM and nmAbs corresponding to this group demonstrated V5-dependent neutralization similar to both the RM serum and the human Z1800M nmAb. The results demonstrate that neutralizing antibody responses elicited by the Z1800M T/F Env in RM converged with those in the HIV-1 infected human subject, illustrating the potential of using immunogens based on this or other T/F Envs with well-defined immunogenicity as a starting point to drive breadth.\n",
      "In low income countries such as Uganda progress has been made towards achieving the United Nations AIDS programme 95-95-95 target however efforts are still impeded by pretreatment drug resistance and adverse drug events (ADEs) hence introduction of dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy as first-line treatment due to a higher genetic barrier to resistance, better tolerability and safety profile. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding its safety in real-clinical settings due to ADEs and being a recently introduced drug there is need to actively monitor for ADEs, hence this study aimed to establish the prevalence and factors associated with ADEs among patients on dolutegravir-based regimen at the Immune Suppression Syndrome (ISS) Clinic- Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH).\n",
      "A mixed design study was conducted at ISS Clinic-MRRH among 375 randomly selected patients who had been exposed to DTG-based regimen for at-least 12 weeks. These were interviewed to obtain data on socio-demographics, dietary habits and their files reviewed for ADEs. Data entry was done using Epi-data 3.0 and exported to SPSS 25.0 for analysis. Prevalence was determined as a percentage, and ADE associated factors assessed using bivariate analysis, those found significant were further subjected to multivariate analysis and considered significant at P < 0.05.\n",
      "The prevalence of ADEs among patients on DTG-based regimen was found to be 33.1% (124/375) with 5.6% (7/124) participants discontinued from treatment due ADEs, 4 due to hyperglycemia and 3 liver toxicity. The commonly experienced ADE was allergy at 36.3%. Male sex (AOR 1.571, 95% CI 1.433-1.984), WHO stage one at entry to care (AOR 4.586, 95% CI 1.649-12.754), stage two (AOR 4.536, 95% CI 1.611-12.776), stage three (AOR 3.638, 95% CI 1.262-10.488), were significantly associated with ADEs.

      "Despite multiple attempts, there is still no effective HIV-1 vaccine available. The HIV-1 polymerase (pol) gene is highly conserved and encodes cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. The aim of the study was to characterise HIV-1 Pol CTL epitopes in mostly sample pairs obtained during early and chronic stages of infection.\n",
      "Illumina deep sequencing was performed for all samples while Sanger sequencing was only performed on baseline samples. Codons under immune selection pressure were assessed by computing nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratios using MEGA. Minority CTL epitope variants occurring at [Formula: see text] 5% were detected using low-frequency variant tool in CLC Genomics. Los Alamos HIV database was used for mapping mutations to known HIV-1 CTL epitopes.\n",
      "Fifty-two participants were enrolled in the study. Their median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 24-32 years) and majority of participants (92.3%) were female. Illumina minority variant analysis identified a significantly higher number of CTL epitopes (n = 65) compared to epitopes (n = 8) identified through Sanger sequencing. Most of the identified epitopes mapped to reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) regardless of sequencing method. There was a significantly higher proportion of minority variant epitopes in RT (n = 39, 60.0%) compared to IN (n = 17, 26.2%) and PR (n = 9, 13.8%), p = 0.002 and < 0.0001, respectively. However, no significant difference was observed between the proportion of minority variant epitopes in IN versus PR, p = 0.06. Some epitopes were detected in either early or chronic HIV-1 infection whereas others were detected in both stages. Different distribution patterns of minority variant epitopes were observed in sample pairs; with some increasing or decreasing over time, while others remained constant. Some of the identified epitopes have not been previously reported for HIV-1 subtype C. There were also variants that could not be mapped to reported CTL epitopes in the Los Alamos HIV database.\n",

      "The incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) in the pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) population remains high in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined trends of KS prevalence in adults, establishing initial outpatient HIV care from 2006 to 2017 in Nigeria.\n",
      "We analyzed data of 16,431 adults (age ≥ 18 years) enrolled for HIV care from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2017, in a large clinic in Jos, Nigeria. KS at enrollment was defined as KS recorded in the electronic health record within 30 days of clinic enrollment. Time trends were compared among four periods: 2006-2008, 2009-2011, 2012-2014, and 2015-2017 using logistic regression models. Annual trends were analyzed using join point regression and restricted splines.\n",
      "The study population had a mean age 35.1 (standard deviation, SD 9.5) years, and were 65.7% female (n = 10,788). The mean CD4 cell count was 220 (95% CI 117-223). The overall KS prevalence at entry was 0.59% (95% CI 0.48-0.72). Compared to 2006-2008, KS prevalence was significantly higher in 2009-2011 (adjusted odds ratio 5.07 (95% CI 3.12-8.24), p < 0.001), but remained unchanged in subsequent periods. Male sex and low CD4 T-cell count independently increased odds for KS.\n",
      "Despite ART expansion, KS at enrollment showed no significant decline. The low CD4 cell count, across all periods, indicates delay in enrollment for HIV care, which increases KS risk. Interventions aimed at early HIV diagnosis and linkage to ART is critical to KS risk reduction in this population.\n",
      "As antiretroviral therapy (ART) has scaled up and HIV incidence has declined, some have questioned the continued utility of HIV prevention. This study examines the role and cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention in the context of \"universal test and treat\" (UTT) in three sub-Saharan countries with generalized HIV epidemics.\n",
      "Scenarios were created in Spectrum/Goals models for Lesotho, Mozambique, and Uganda with various combinations of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC); pre-exposure prophylaxis; and a highly effective, durable, hypothetical vaccine layered onto three different ART scenarios. One ART scenario held coverage constant at 2008 levels to replicate prevention modeling studies that were conducted prior to UTT. One scenario assumed scale-up to the UNAIDS treatment goals of 90-90-90 by 2025 and 95-95-95 by 2030. An intermediate scenario held ART constant at 2019 coverage. HIV incidence was visualized over time, and cost per HIV infection averted was assessed over 5-, 15-, and 30-year time frames, with 3% annual discounting.\n",
      "Each prevention intervention reduced HIV incidence beyond what was achieved by ART scale-up alone to the 90-90-90/95-95-95 goals, with near-zero incidence achievable by combinations of interventions covering all segments of the population. Cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention may decrease as HIV incidence decreases, but one-time interventions like VMMC and a durable vaccine may remain cost-effective and even cost-saving as ART is scaled up.\n",
      "Primary HIV prevention is still needed in the era of UTT. Combination prevention is more impactful than a single, highly effective intervention. Broad population coverage of primary prevention, regardless of cost-effectiveness, will be required in generalized epidemic countries to eradicate HIV.\n",
      "Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a cornerstone of HIV-1 vaccine strategies. Comparing HIV-1 envelope (env) sequences from the first weeks of infection to the breadth of antibody responses observed several years after infection can help define viral features critical to vaccine design. We investigated the relationship between HIV-1 env genetics and the development of neutralization breadth in 70 individuals enrolled in a prospective acute HIV-1 cohort. Half of the individuals who developed bnAbs were infected with multiple HIV-1 founder variants, whereas all individuals with limited neutralization breadth had been infected with single HIV-1 founders. Accordingly, at HIV-1 diagnosis, env diversity was significantly higher in participants who later developed bnAbs compared to those with limited breadth (p = 0.012). This association between founder multiplicity and the subsequent development of neutralization breadth was also observed in 56 placebo recipients in the RV144 vaccine efficacy trial. In addition, we found no evidence that neutralization breath was heritable when analyzing env sequences from the 126 participants. These results demonstrate that the presence of slightly different HIV-1 variants in acute infection could promote the induction of bnAbs, suggesting a novel vaccine strategy, whereby an initial immunization with a cocktail of minimally distant antigens would be able to initiate bnAb development towards breadth.\n",

      "The TasP trial was a cluster-randomized trial in South Africa from 2012 to 2016. All households were offered 6-monthly home-based HIV testing. Immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) was offered through trial clinics to all people living with HIV (PLHIV) in intervention clusters and according to national guidelines in control clusters. After the trial, individuals attending the trial clinics were transferred to the public ART programme. Deaths were ascertained through annual demographic surveillance. Random-effects Poisson regression was used to estimate the effect of trial arm on mortality among (i) all PLHIV; (ii) PLHIV aware of their status and not on ART at trial entry; and (iii) PHLIV who started ART during the trial.\n",
      "Mortality rates among PLHIV were 9.3/1000 and 10.4/1000 person-years in the control and intervention arms, respectively. There was no evidence that the intervention decreased mortality among all PLHIV [adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.85-1.43, p = 0.46] or among PLHIV who were aware of their status but not on ART. Among individuals who initiated ART, the intervention decreased mortality during the trial (aRR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.28-0.85, p = 0.01), but not after the trial ended.\n",

In this article, we argue that it is critical to consider social contexts in the development of HIV cure trial protocols. The biological and behavioral risk factors for HIV acquisition by study participants are inseparable from the social context in which these participants live. The article discusses an example of a cohort established to further HIV cure research that included social context, called the FRESH Acute HIV study, which combines a sociostructural intervention while conducting HIV prevention, treatment and cure-related research in Durban, South Africa.

Using RNA-Seq we explored CD4 T cell gene expression to identify evidence of a mechanism that might underpin virological rebound and lead to discovery of associated biomarkers. Fourteen female participants who received 12 months of ART starting from primary HIV infection were sampled at the time of stopping therapy. Two analysis methods (Differential Gene Expression with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) were employed to interrogate CD4+ T cell gene expression data and study pathways enriched in post-treatment controllers versus early rebounders. Using independent analysis tools, expression of genes associated with type I interferon responses were associated with a delayed time to viral rebound following treatment interruption (TI). Expression of four genes identified by Cox-Lasso (ISG15, XAF1, TRIM25 and USP18) was converted to a Risk Score, which associated with rebound (p < 0.01). These data link transcriptomic signatures associated with innate immunity with control following stopping ART. The results from this small sample need to be confirmed in larger trials, but could help define strategies for new therapies and identify new biomarkers for remission.\n",
      "To help diagnose and initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥95% of all persons living with HIV (PLHIV), the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends offering HIV testing to biological children, and sexual and needle-sharing partners of all PLHIV (index-client testing, ICT). Many index clients, however, do not identify or have contactable partners, and often substantially fewer than 95% of HIV-positive partners initiate ART soon after index testing. To help improve early HIV diagnosis and ART initiation in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), we implemented a community-based HIV testing and peer-delivered, linkage case management program (CommLink) that provided ICT as part of a comprehensive package of WHO recommended linkage services. CommLink was implemented June 2015 -March 2017 (Phase I), and April 2017 -September 2018 (Phase II). In addition to biological children and partners, HIV testing was offered to adult family members (Phases I and II) and high-risk associates including friends and acquaintances (Phase II) of CommLink index clients. Compared with Phase I, in Phase II proportionally more CommLink clients disclosed their HIV-infection status to a partner or family member [94% (562/598) vs. 75% (486/652)], and had ≥1 partners, family members, or high-risk associates (contacts) tested through CommLink [41% (245/598) vs. 18% (117/652)]. Of 537 contacts tested, 253 (47%) were HIV-positive and not currently in HIV care, including 17% (17/100) of family members aged <15 years, 42% (78/187) of non-partner family members aged ≥15 years, 60% (73/121) of sexual partners, and 66% (85/129) of high-risk associates. Among 210 HIV-positive contacts aged ≥15 years who participated in CommLink, nearly all received recommended linkage services including treatment navigation (95%), weekly telephone follow-up (93%), and ≥3 counseling sessions (94%); peer counselors resolved 76% (306/404) of identified barriers to care (e.g., perceived wellness); and 200 (95%) initiated ART at a healthcare facility, of whom 196 (98%) received at least one antiretroviral refill before case-management services ended. To help countries achieve ≥90% ART coverage among all PLHIV, expanding ICT for adult family members and high-risk associates of index clients, and providing peer-delivered linkage case management for all identified PLHIV, should be considered.\n",

      "To estimate the incidence and explore risk factors of cancer in a cohort of PLWH in Harare using probabilistic record linkage (PRL).\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included PLWH aged ≥16 years starting ART between 2004 and 2017. We used PRL to match records from the Zimbabwe National Cancer Registry (ZNCR) with electronic medical records from an ART clinic in Harare to investigate the incidence of cancer among PLWH initiating ART. We matched records based on demographic data followed by manual clerical review. We followed PLWH up until first cancer diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or 31 December 2017, whichever came first.\n",

      "Models estimate that the disability burden from mental disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will more than double in the next 40 years. Similar to HIV, mental disorders are stigmatized in many SSA settings and addressing them requires community engagement and long-term treatment. Yet, in contrast to HIV, the public mental healthcare cascade has not been sustained, despite robust data on scalable strategies. We draw on findings from our International AIDS Society (IAS) 2020 virtual workshop and make recommendations for next steps in the scale up of the SSA public mental healthcare continuum.\n",
      "Early HIV surveillance and care cascade targets are discussed as important strategies for HIV response in SSA that should be adopted for mental health. Advocacy, including engagement with civil society, and targeted economic arguments to policymakers, are reviewed in the context of HIV success in SSA. Parallel opportunities for mental disorders are identified. Learning from HIV, communication of strategies that advance mental health care needs in SSA must be prioritized for broad global audiences.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic is setting off a colossal escalation of global mental health care needs, well-publicized across scientific, media, policymaker, and civil society domains. The pandemic highlights disparities in healthcare access and reinvigorates the push for universal coverage. Learning from HIV strategies, we must seize this historical moment to improve the public mental health care cascade in SSA and capitalize on the powerful alliances ready to be forged.

      "Non-facility-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery for people with stable HIV might increase sustainable ART coverage in low-income and middle-income countries. Within the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, two interventions, home-based delivery (HBD) and adherence clubs (AC), which included groups of 15-30 participants who met at a communal venue, were compared with standard of care (SoC). In this trial we looked at the effectiveness and feasibility of these alternative models of care. Specifically, this trial aimed to assess whether these models of care had similar virological suppression to that of SoC 12 months after enrolment.\n",
      "This was a three-arm, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial, done in two urban communities in Lusaka, Zambia included in the HPTN 071 trial. The two communities were split into zones, which were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the three treatment strategies: 35 zones to the SoC group, 35 zones to the HBD group, and 34 zones to the AC group. ART and adherence support were delivered once every 3 months at home for the HBD group, in groups of 15-30 people in the AC group, or in the clinic for the SoC group. Adults with HIV who were receiving first-line ART for at least 6 months, virally suppressed using national HIV guidelines in the last 12 months, had no other health conditions requiring the clinicians attention, live in the study catchment area, and provided written informed consent, were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoint was viral suppression at 12 months (with a 6 month final measurement window [ie, 9-15 months]), defined as less than 1000 HIV RNA copies per mL, with a non-inferiority margin of 5%.\n",
      "Between May 5 and Dec 19, 2017, 9900 individuals were screened for inclusion, of whom 2489 (25·1%) participants were enrolled into the trial: 781 (31%) in the SoC group, 852 (34%) in the HBD group, and 856 (34%) in the AC group. A higher proportion of participants had viral load measurements in the primary outcome window in the HBD (581 [61%]of 852 participants) and AC (485 [57%] of 856 participants) groups than in the SoC (390 [50%] of 781 patients) group (p=0·0021). Of the 1096 missing observations, 152 (13·8%) were attributable to either deaths (25 [16%] participants), relocations (37 [24%] participants), or lost to follow-up (90 [59%]); 690 (63·0%) participants had viral load results outside the window period; and 254 (23·2%) did not have a viral load result. The prevalence of viral suppression was estimated to be 98·3% (95% CI 96·6 to 99·7) in the SoC group, 98·7% (97·5 to 99·6) in the HBD group, and 99·2% (98·4 to 99·8) in the AC group. This gave an estimated risk difference of 0·3% (95% CI -1·5 to 2·4) for the HBD group compared with the SoC group and 0·9% (-0·8 to 2·8) for the AC group compared with the SoC group. There was strong evidence (p<0·0001) that both community ART models were non-inferior to the SoC group (p<0·0001).\n",

      "Serological tests based on the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are the primary tool for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in adults and have rapidly evolved to quicker, affordable and more accurate test formats to detect early HIV infection. Second- and third-generation HIV rapid tests detect the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the HIV and are used at the point of care and in HIV self-testing. The tests are affordable and accessible in state and private diagnostic laboratories. The present-day fourth- and fifth-generation EIAs can detect both p24 antigen and IgG and IgM HIV antibodies and thereby diagnose early HIV infection at approximately 2 weeks. The fourth- and fifth-generation EIAs also report sensitivity and specificity of more than 99%. The correct interpretation of HIV diagnosis of false-positive and false-negative EIA test results requires collaborative scrutiny of patient factors and laboratory test methodologies.\n",
      "Despite antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses being implicated in protection from HIV-1 infection, there is limited evidence that they control virus replication. The high mutability of HIV-1 enables the virus to rapidly adapt, and thus evidence of viral escape is a very sensitive approach to demonstrate the importance of this response. To enable us to deconvolute ADCC escape from neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, we identified individuals soon after infection with detectable ADCC responses, but no nAb responses. We evaluated the kinetics of ADCC and nAb responses, and viral escape, in five recently HIV-1-infected individuals. In one individual we detected viruses that escaped from ADCC responses but were sensitive to nAbs. In the remaining four participants, we did not find evidence of viral evolution exclusively associated with ADCC-mediating non-neutralizing Abs (nnAbs). However, in all individuals escape from nAbs was rapid, occurred at very low titers, and in three of five cases we found evidence of viral escape before detectable nAb responses. These data show that ADCC-mediating nnAbs can drive immune escape in early infection, but that nAbs were far more effective. This suggests that if ADCC responses have a protective role, their impact is limited after systemic virus dissemination.\n",
      "Without high-quality nutritional support, there is a risk that people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will replace lost muscle mass with fat mass when initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). We have shown that lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) with whey or soy considerably increases lean mass among Ethiopian people with HIV starting ART. Here, we aim to assess the effects of LNS on insulin function and glucose metabolism.\n",
      "This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial testing the effect of three-month supplementation with LNS containing whey (LNS/whey) or soy (LNS/soy) among people with HIV. LNS/whey and LNS/soy groups were combined and then were compared against the non-supplemented group. The outcomes were change in fasting plasma-glucose (FPG), and 30-min glucose and 120-min glucose after oral glucose tolerance test. We further assessed effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment index for beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).\n",
      "Of the 318 patients enrolled, 268 (84.3%) had available FPG and HbA1c and included. After 3 months of ART, HbA1c tended to be 2 mmol/mol higher in the LNS supplemented group, most pronounced among those receiving whey as the protein source. LNS led to higher 30-min glucose (0.5 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.2, 0.8) and 120-min glucose (0.4 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.03, 0.8) and a > 50% increase in fasting insulin, HOMA-B and HOMA-IR compared to the non-supplemented.\n",
      "Among Ethiopian people with HIV initiating ART, short-term LNS intake increased glucose and insulin levels, and tended to increase HbA1c, potentially leading to more insulin resistance. Higher intake of carbohydrates with LNS could influence glycemic status. Whether these metabolic changes in early HIV treatment are beneficial or increase long-term risk of metabolic disorders needs to be explored.\n",
      "The inflammasome pathway is an important arm of the innate immune system that provides antiviral immunity against many viruses. The main pathways involved in virus infections include the NLRP3, IFI16, and AIM2 pathways. However, a succinct understanding of its role in HIV is not yet well elucidated. In this review, we showed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a vital role in inhibiting HIV entry into target cells via the purinergic pathway; IFI16 detects intracellular HIV ssDNA, triggers interferon I and III production, and inhibits HIV transcription; and AIM2 binds to HIV dsDNA and triggers acute inflammation and pyroptosis. Remarkably, by understanding these mechanisms, new therapeutic strategies can be developed against the disease.\n",
      "Reduction of the reservoir of latent HIV-infected cells might increase the possibility of long-term remission in individuals living with HIV. We investigated factors associated with HIV-1 proviral DNA levels in children receiving different antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategies in the children with HIV early antiretroviral therapy (CHER) trial.\n",
      "Infants with HIV  <  12 weeks old with CD4%  ≥  25% were randomized in the CHER trial to early limited ART for 40 or 96 weeks (ART-40 W, ART-96 W), or deferred ART (ART-Def). For ART-Def infants or following ART interruption in ART-40 W/ART-96 W, ART was started/re-started for clinical progression or CD4%  <  25%. In 229 participants, HIV-1 proviral DNA was quantified by PCR from stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children who had received  ≥  24 weeks ART and two consecutive undetectable HIV-1 RNA 12-24 weeks apart. HIV-1 proviral DNA was compared between ART-Def and ART-96 W at week 96, and in all arms at week 248. Factors associated with HIV-1 proviral DNA levels were evaluated using linear regression.\n",
      "Longer duration of ART was significantly associated with lower HIV-1 proviral DNA at both 96 (p  =  0.0003) and 248 weeks (p  =  0.0011). Higher total CD8 count at ART initiation was associated with lower HIV-1 proviral DNA at both 96 (p  =  0.0225) and 248 weeks (p  =  0.0398). Week 248 HIV-1 proviral DNA was significantly higher in those with positive HIV-1 serology at week 84 than those with negative serology (p  =  0.0042).\n",

      "The lack of acute and early HIV infection (AEHI) diagnosis and care contributes to high HIV incidence in resource-limited settings. We aimed to assess the yield of AEHI, predict and diagnose AEHI, and describe AEHI care outcomes in a public sector setting in Eswatini.\n",

AEHI was defined as the detection of HIV-1 VL on Xpert and either an HIV-seronegative or HIV-serodiscordant third-generation antibody-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) result. First, the cross-sectional analysis obtained the yield of AEHI and established a predictor risk score for the prediction of AEHI using Lasso logistic regression. Second, diagnostic accuracy statistics described the ability of the fourth-generation antibody/p24 antigen-based Alere HIV-Combo RDT to diagnose AEHI (vs Xpert VL testing). Third, we described acute HIV infection care outcomes of AEHI-positive patients using survival analysis.\n",

Patients with a risk score ≥ 2 and no previous HIV diagnosis were enrolled in a stepped-wedge trial of opt-out delivery of point-of-care (POC) HIV-1 nucleic acid testing (NAAT), compared with standard provider-initiated HIV testing using rapid tests in the observation period. The primary outcome was the number of new diagnoses in each study period.

      "Between 2017 and 2020, 13 (0.9%) out of 1374 participants in the observation period and 37 (2.5%) out of 1500 participants in the intervention period were diagnosed with HIV infection. Of the 37 newly diagnosed cases in the intervention period, two (5.4%) had AHI. Participants in the opt-out intervention had a two-fold greater odds of being diagnosed with HIV (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.39-3.51) after adjustment for factors imbalanced across study periods.\n",
      "Among symptomatic adults aged 18-39 years targeted by our POC NAAT intervention, we identified one chronic HIV infection for every 40 patients and one AHI patient for every 750 patients tested.

      "Recent declines in adult HIV-1 incidence have followed the large-scale expansion of antiretroviral therapy and primary HIV prevention across high-burden communities of sub-Saharan Africa. Mathematical modeling suggests that HIV risk will decline disproportionately in younger adult age-groups as interventions scale, concentrating new HIV infections in those >age 25 over time. Yet, no empirical data exist to support these projections. We conducted a population-based cohort study over a 16-y period (2004 to 2019), spanning the early scale-up of antiretroviral therapy and voluntary medical male circumcision, to estimate changes in the age distribution of HIV incidence in a hyperepidemic region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where adult HIV incidence has recently declined. Median age of HIV seroconversion increased by 5.5 y in men and 3.0 y in women, and the age of peak HIV incidence increased by 5.0 y in men and 2.0 y in women. Incidence declined disproportionately among young men (64% in men 15 to 19, 68% in men 20 to 24, and 46% in men 25 to 29) and young women (44% in women 15 to 19, 24% in women 20 to 24) comparing periods pre- versus post-universal test and treat. Incidence was stable (<20% change) in women aged 30 to 39 and men aged 30 to 34. Age shifts in incidence occurred after 2012 and were observed earlier in men than in women. These results provide direct epidemiological evidence of the changing demographics of HIV risk in sub-Saharan Africa in the era of large-scale treatment and prevention. More attention is needed to address lagging incidence decline among older individuals.\n",
      "Identifying whether viral features present in acute HIV-1 infection predetermine the development of neutralization breadth is critical to vaccine design. Incorporating such features in vaccine antigens could initiate cross-reactive antibody responses that could sufficiently protect vaccinees from HIV-1 infection despite the uniqueness of each founder virus. To understand the relationship between Env determinants and the development of neutralization breadth, we focused on 197 individuals enrolled in two cohorts in Thailand and East Africa (RV144 and RV217) and followed since their diagnosis in acute or early HIV-1 infection. We analyzed the distribution of variable loop lengths and glycans, as well as the predicted density of the glycan shield, and compared these envelope features to the neutralization breadth data obtained 3 years after infection (\n",

Although HIV-1 bnAb epitopes have been identified and mechanisms of action studied, current HIV-1 envelope-based immunogens do not elicit HIV-1 bnAbs in humans or animal models. A better understanding of how HIV-1 bnAbs arise during infection and the clinical factors associated with bnAb development may be critical for HIV-1 immunogen design efforts.\n",
      "Longitudinal plasma samples from the treatment-naive control arm of the Short Pulse Anti-Retroviral Therapy at Seroconversion (SPARTAC) primary HIV-1 infection cohort were used in an HIV-1 pseudotype neutralization assay to measure the neutralization breadth, potency and specificity of bnAb responses over time.\n",
      "In the SPARTAC cohort, development of plasma neutralization breadth and potency correlates with duration of HIV infection and high viral loads, and typically takes 3-4 years to arise. bnAb activity was mostly directed to one or two bnAb epitopes per donor and more than 60% of donors with the highest plasma neutralization having bnAbs targeted towards glycan-dependent epitopes.\n",

Mobilized participants received clinic-based rapid antibody testing and point-of-care HIV RNA testing. Newly diagnosed participants including those derived from HIV testing services were offered immediate ART and HPN. Partners were recruited through HPN.\n",
      "Of 772 mobilized clients, 452 (58.5%) enrolled in the study as mobilized participants. Of these, 16 (3.5%) were HIV newly diagnosed, including 2 (0.4%) with AEHI. All but 2 (14/16 [87.5%]) initiated ART. Thirty-five GBMSM and TGW were offered HPN and 27 (77.1%) accepted it. Provider referral identified a higher proportion of partners tested (39/64 [60.9%] vs 5/14 [35.7%]) and partners with HIV (27/39 [69.2%] vs 2/5 [40.0%]) than index referral. Of 44 enrolled partners, 10 (22.7%) were newly diagnosed, including 3 (6.8%) with AEHI. All 10 (100%) initiated ART.

Balanced accuracy was 90.6% (95% confidence interval, 86.7%-94.1%). We tested the algorithm among newly diagnosed participants with or without documented negative HIV tests. Among those without records, those who self-reported a negative HIV test within <1 year were more frequently classified as recent than those who reported a test >1 year previously. There was no difference in classification between those self-reporting a negative HIV test <1 year, whether or not they had a record.\n",

      "Factors that influence viral response when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated in neonates are not well characterized. We assessed if there is consistency in predictive factors when operationalizing viral response using different methods. Data were collected from a clinical study in South Africa that started ART in neonates within 14 days of birth (2013-2018). Among 61 infants followed for ≥48 weeks after ART initiation, viral response through 72 weeks was defined by three methods: (1) clinical endpoints (virologic success, rebound, and failure); (2) time to viral suppression, i.e., any viral load (VL: copies/mL) <400, <50, or target not detected (TND) using time-to-event methods; and (3) latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to empirically estimate discrete groups with shared patterns of VL trajectories over time. We investigated the following factors: age at ART initiation, sex, birthweight, preterm birth, mode of delivery, breastfeeding, pre-treatment VL and CD4, maternal ART during pregnancy, and maternal VL and CD4 count. ART was initiated 0-48 h of birth among 57.4% of the infants, 48 h-7 days in 29.5% and 8-14 days in 13.1%. By Method 1, infants were categorized into 'success' (54.1%), 'rebound' (21.3%), and 'failure' (24.6%) for viral response. For Method 2, median time to achieving a VL <400, <50, or TND was 58, 123, and 331 days, respectively. For Method 3, infants were categorized into three trajectories: 'rapid decline' (29.5%), 'slow decline' (47.5%), and 'persistently high' (23.0%). All methods found that higher pre-treatment VL, particularly >100,000, was associated with less favorable viral outcomes. No exposure to maternal ART was associated with a better viral response, while a higher maternal VL was associated with less favorable viral response and higher maternal CD4 was associated with better viral response across all three methods. The LCGA method found that infants who initiated ART 8-14 days had less favorable viral response than those who initiated ART earlier. The other two methods trended in a similar direction. Across three methods to operationalize viral response in the context of early infant treatment, findings of factors associated with viral response were largely consistent, including infant pre-treatment VL, maternal VL, and maternal CD4 count.\n",

      "Early HIV diagnosis allows combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation in the first days of life following in utero (IU) infection. The impact of early cART initiation on infant viral reservoir size in the setting of high-frequency cART nonadherence is unknown.\n",
      "Peripheral blood total HIV DNA from 164 early treated (day 0-21 of life) IU HIV-infected South African infants was measured using droplet digital PCR at birth and following suppressive cART. We evaluated the impact of cART initiation timing on HIV reservoir size and decay, and on the risk of subsequent plasma viremia in cART-suppressed infants.\n",
      "Baseline HIV DNA (median 2.8 log10 copies/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, range 0.7-4.8) did not correlate with age at cART initiation (0-21 days) but instead with maternal antenatal cART use. In 98 infants with plasma viral suppression on cART, HIV DNA half-life was 28 days. However, the probability of maintenance of plasma aviremia was low (0.46 at 12 months) and not influenced by HIV DNA load. Unexpectedly, longer time to viral suppression was associated with protection against subsequent viral rebound.\n",
      "With effective prophylaxis against mother-to-child transmission, cART initiation timing in the first 3 weeks of life is not critical to reservoir size.\n",
      "Frequent retesting for HIV among persons at increased risk of HIV infection is critical to early HIV diagnosis of persons and delivery of combination HIV prevention services. There are few evidence-based interventions for promoting frequent retesting for HIV. We sought to determine the effectiveness of financial incentives and deposit contracts in promoting quarterly HIV retesting among adults at increased risk of HIV.\n",
      "In peri-urban Ugandan communities from October to December 2018, we randomized HIV-negative adults with self-reported risk to 1 of 3 strategies to promote HIV retesting: (1) no incentive; (2) cash incentives (US$7) for retesting at 3 and 6 months (total US$14); or (3) deposit contracts: participants could voluntarily deposit US$6 at baseline and at 3 months that would be returned with interest (total US$7) upon retesting at 3 and 6 months (total US$14) or lost if participants failed to retest. The primary outcome was retesting for HIV at both 3 and 6 months. Of 1,482 persons screened for study eligibility following community-based recruitment, 524 participants were randomized to either no incentive (N = 180), incentives (N = 172), or deposit contracts (N = 172): median age was 25 years (IQR: 22 to 30), 44% were women, and median weekly income was US$13.60 (IQR: US$8.16 to US$21.76). Among participants randomized to deposit contracts, 24/172 (14%) made a baseline deposit, and 2/172 (1%) made a 3-month deposit. In intent-to-treat analyses, HIV retesting at both 3 and 6 months was significantly higher in the incentive arm (89/172 [52%]) than either the control arm (33/180 [18%], odds ratio (OR) 4.8, 95% CI: 3.0 to 7.7, p < 0.001) or the deposit contract arm (28/172 [16%], OR 5.5, 95% CI: 3.3 to 9.1, p < 0.001). Among those in the deposit contract arm who made a baseline deposit, 20/24 (83%) retested at 3 months; 11/24 (46%) retested at both 3 and 6 months. Among 282 participants who retested for HIV during the trial, three (1%; 95%CI: 0.2 to 3%) seroconverted: one in the incentive group and two in the control group. Study limitations include measurement of retesting at the clinic where baseline enrollment occurred, only offering clinic-based (rather than community-based) HIV retesting and lack of measurement of retesting after completion of the trial to evaluate sustained retesting behavior.\n",
      "Offering financial incentives to high-risk adults in Uganda resulted in significantly higher HIV retesting. Deposit contracts had low uptake and overall did not increase retesting. As part of efforts to increase early diagnosis of HIV among high-risk populations, strategic use of incentives to promote retesting should receive greater consideration by HIV programs.\n",

      "HIV diagnosis is the necessary first step towards HIV care initiation, yet many persons living with HIV (PLWH) remain undiagnosed. Employing multiple HIV testing strategies in tandem could increase HIV detection and promote linkage to care. We aimed to assess an intervention to improve HIV detection within socio-sexual networks of PLWH in two sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi.\n",
      "We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an intervention combining acute HIV infection (AHI) screening, contract partner notification and social contact referral versus the Malawian standard of care: serial rapid serological HIV tests and passive partner referral. Enrolment occurred between 2015 and 2019. HIV-seropositive persons (two positive rapid tests) were randomized to the trial arms and HIV-seronegative (one negative rapid test) and -serodiscordant (one positive test followed by a negative confirmatory test) persons were screened for AHI with HIV RNA testing. Those found to have AHI were offered enrolment into the intervention arm. Our primary outcome of interest was the number of new HIV diagnoses made per index participant within participants' sexual and social networks. We also calculated total persons, sexual partners and PLWH (including those previously diagnosed) referred per index participant.\n",
      "A total of 1230 HIV-seropositive persons were randomized to the control arm, and 561 to the intervention arm. Another 12,713 HIV-seronegative or -serodiscordant persons underwent AHI screening, resulting in 136 AHI cases, of whom 94 enrolled into the intervention arm. The intervention increased the number of new HIV diagnoses made per index participant versus the control (ratio: 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2 to 3.1). The intervention also increased the numbers of persons (ratio: 2.5; 95% CI: 2.0 to 3.2), sexual partners (ratio: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.4 to 2.0) and PLWH (ratio: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.7 to 3.2) referred per index participant.\n",
      "Combining three distinct HIV testing and referral strategies increased the detection of previously undiagnosed HIV infections within the socio-sexual networks of PLWH seeking STI care. Combination HIV detection strategies that leverage AHI screening and socio-sexual contact networks offer a novel and efficacious approach to increasing HIV status awareness.\n",

      "Concordance of cobas HIV-1/2 Qual test with the comparator serological test and COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan test was ≥99.6% with all sample types. Reactivity with all HIV genotypes was 100%. LOD in plasma samples was 14.8, 12.6, and 27.9 copies/mL for HIV-1 group M, HIV-1 group O, and HIV-2, respectively, with similar results for serum samples. LOD in dried blood spots was 255 copies/mL for HIV-1 and 984 copies/mL for HIV-2. HIV infection was detected 18.9 days and 8.5 days earlier than the confirmatory and serological assays, respectively, and at a similar time to the NAT.\n",

      "HIV is a major contributor to infant mortality. A significant gap remains between the uptake of infant and maternal antiretroviral regimens and only a minority of HIV-exposed infants receives prophylaxis and safe infant feeding. Losses to follow-up of HIV-exposed infants are associated with shortcomings of facility-based PMTCT models with weak community support of linkages. Use of mobile phones offers an opportunity for improving care and promoting retention assessed by timely attendance of scheduled appointments for the mother-baby pairs and achievement of an HIV-free generation. The objective of this study was to compare self-reported adherence to infant Nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis and retention in care assessed by timely attendance of scheduled appointments over 10 weeks in HIV exposed infants randomized to 2-weekly mobile phone calls (intervention) versus no phone calls (control).\n",
      "In this open label randomized controlled study, one hundred and fifty HIV infected women drawn from 3 health facilities in Western Kenya and their infants were randomly assigned to receive either phone-based reminders on PMTCT messages or standard health care messages (no calls) within 24 h of delivery. Women in the intervention arm continued to receive fortnightly phone calls. At 6- and 10-weeks following randomization we collected data on infant adherence to Nevirapine, mode of infant feeding, early HIV testing and retention in care in both study arms. All analyses were intention to treat.\n",
      "At 6 weeks follow-up, 90.7% (n = 68) of participants receiving phone calls reported adherence to infant NVP prophylaxis, compared with 72% (n = 54) of participants in the control group (p = 0.005). Participants in the intervention arm were also significantly more likely to remain in care than participants in the control group [78.7% (n = 59) vs. 58.7% (n = 44), p = 0.009 at 6 weeks and 69.3% (n = 52) vs. 37.3% (n = 28), p < 0.001 at 10 weeks].\n",

      "An exploratory descriptive qualitative research method was employed to explore physiotherapists' perceptions and experiences regarding bone health and falls in PLWH. In-depth semi-structured telephonic interviews were used to collect data from 21 physiotherapists working in primary HIV care. Transcribed interview data were coded in Atlas.ti.8® and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.\n",

As such, physiotherapists did not link falls or fractures to HIV or antiretroviral therapy (ART) when they did observe such events during their general patient assessments. However, in retrospect, some physiotherapists were able to recognise risk factors linked to falls in those with HIV. Current services for falls prevention, as perceived by the physiotherapists, were sub-optimal.\n",

Reporting ill-health as the main reason for testing was categorized as symptomatic. Modified Poisson regression was used to evaluate predictors of motivators for HIV testing.Overall, 327/520 (62.9%) participants reported symptoms as the main motivator for testing. Among the asymptomatic, 17.1% reported potential HIV exposure as a reason for testing, while 20.0% just wanted to know their HIV status. Baseline predictors of symptom-related motivators for HIV testing include disclosing intention to test (aPR 1.4 for family/friend/others vs partners/spouse, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8; aPR 1.4 for not disclosing vs partners/spouse, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7), and HIV testing history (aPR 1.2 for last HIV test >12-months ago vs last test 12-months prior, 95% CI: 1.0-1.5; aPR 1.3 for never tested for HIV before vs last test 12-months prior, 95%CI:1.0-1.6).Findings indicate that newly diagnosed HIV positive patients still enter care because of ill-health, not prevention purposes. Increasing early HIV testing remains essential to maximize the benefits of expanded ART access.\n",
      "South Africa adopted a universal test and treatment program for HIV infection in 2015. The standard of care that people living with HIV receive consists of 3 sessions of readiness counseling delivered by lay counselors (LCs). In the largest antiretroviral therapy (ART) program worldwide, effective and early HIV and ART education and support are key for ensuring ART adoption, adherence, and retention in care. Having LCs to deliver readiness counseling allows for the wide task-sharing of this critical activity but carries the risks of loss of standardization, incomplete content delivery, and inadequate monitoring and supervision. Systems for ensuring that a minimum standard of readiness counseling is delivered to the growing number of people living with HIV are essential in the care cascade. In resource-constrained, high-burden settings, mobile health (mHealth) apps may potentially offer solutions to these treatment gaps by providing content structure and delivery records.\n",

      "Masivukeni is a laptop-based app that incorporates written content, graphics, short video materials, and participant activities. In total, 20 participants were included in this study. To explore how an mHealth intervention might be adopted across different staff levels within the organization, we conducted 7 semistructured interviews (participants: 7/20, 35%) and 3 focus groups (participants in 2 focus groups: 4/20, 20%; participants in 1 focus group: 3/20, 15%) among LCs, supervisors, and their managers. In total, 20 participants were included in this study. Interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes, and focus groups ranged from 90 to 120 minutes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to explore the perceived implementation barriers and facilitators of the Masivukeni mHealth intervention.\n",
      "Several potential facilitators of Masivukeni were identified. Multimedia and visual elements were generally regarded as aids in content delivery. The interactive learning components were notably helpful, whereas facilitated updates to the adherence curriculum were important to facilitators and managers. The potential to capture administrative information regarding LC delivery and client logging was regarded as an attractive feature. Barriers to implementation included security risks and equipment costs, the high volume of clients to be counseled, and variable computer literacy among LCs. There was uncertainty about the app's appeal to older clients.\n",
      "mHealth apps, such as Masivukeni, were perceived as being well placed to address some of the needs of those who deliver ART adherence counseling in South Africa. However, the successful implementation of mHealth apps appeared to be dependent on overcoming certain barriers in this setting.\n",
      "Individuals infected with HIV display varying rates of viral control and disease progression, with a small percentage of individuals being able to spontaneously control infection in the absence of treatment. In attempting to define the correlates associated with natural protection against HIV, extreme heterogeneity in the datasets generated from systems methodologies can be further complicated by the inherent variability encountered at the population, individual, cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, such studies have been limited by the paucity of well-characterised samples and linked epidemiological data, including duration of infection and clinical outcomes. To address this, we selected 10 volunteers who rapidly and persistently controlled HIV, and 10 volunteers each, from two control groups who failed to control (based on set point viral loads) from an acute and early HIV prospective cohort from East and Southern Africa. A propensity score matching approach was applied to control for the influence of five factors (age, risk group, virus subtype, gender, and country) known to influence disease progression on causal observations. Fifty-two plasma proteins were assessed at two timepoints in the 1st year of infection. We independently confirmed factors known to influence disease progression such as the B\n",
      "Few studies have assessed HIV incidence in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We assessed HIV incidence and its correlates among MSM and TGW in SSA enrolled in the prospective, multi-country HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 075 study, conducted from 2015 to 2017. Participants were enrolled at four sites in SSA (Kisumu, Kenya; Blantyre, Malawi; Cape Town and Soweto, South Africa). Eligible participants reported male sex assignment at birth, were 18 to 44 years of age, and had engaged in anal intercourse with a man in the preceding three months. Participation involved five study visits over 12 months. Visits included behavioral assessments and testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Twenty-one of 329 persons acquired HIV during the study [incidence rate: 6.96/100 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 4.3, 10.6)]. Among TGW, HIV incidence was estimated to be 8.4/100 PY (95% CI: 2.3, 21.5). Four participants were found to have acute HIV infection at their first HIV-positive visit. HIV incidence varied among the four study sites, ranging from 1.3/100 PY to 14.4/100 PY. In multivariate longitudinal analysis, factors significantly associated with HIV acquisition were engagement in unprotected receptive anal intercourse [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4, 14.4] and incident rectal gonorrhea and/or chlamydia (AHR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.8). The higher HIV incidence in Cape Town compared to Blantyre could be explained by the higher prevalence of several risk factors for HIV infection among participants in Cape Town. Annual HIV incidence observed in this study is substantially higher than reported HIV incidence in the general populations in the respective countries and among MSM in the United States. Intensification of HIV prevention efforts for MSM and TGW in SSA is urgently needed.\n",
      "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are critical for defense against airborne pathogens and AM dysfunction is thought to contribute to the increased burden of pulmonary infections observed in individuals living with HIV-1 (HIV). While HIV nucleic acids have been detected in AMs early in infection, circulating HIV during acute and chronic infection is usually CCR5 T cell-tropic (T-tropic) and enters macrophages inefficiently in vitro. The mechanism by which T-tropic viruses infect AMs remains unknown. We collected AMs by bronchoscopy performed in HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and uninfected subjects. We found that viral constructs made with primary HIV envelope sequences isolated from both AMs and plasma were T-tropic and inefficiently infected macrophages. However, these isolates productively infected macrophages when co-cultured with HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. In addition, we provide evidence that T-tropic HIV is transmitted from infected CD4+ T cells to the AM cytosol. We conclude that AM-derived HIV isolates are T-tropic and can enter macrophages through contact with an infected CD4+ T cell, which results in productive infection of AMs. CD4+ T cell-dependent entry of HIV into AMs helps explain the presence of HIV in AMs despite inefficient cell-free infection, and may contribute to AM dysfunction in people living with HIV.\n",
      "There were approximately 37.9 million persons infected with HIV in 2018 globally, resulting in 770,000 deaths annually. Over 50% of this infection and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, with countries like Nigeria being seriously affected. Nigeria has one of the highest rates of new infections globally. To control HIV infection in Nigeria, there is a need to continually screen high-risk groups for early HIV infection and subtypes using very sensitive methods. In this study, new HIV-1 infection and circulating HIV-1 subtypes among febrile persons and blood donors were determined. Performance characteristics of three commercial EIA kits were also evaluated.\n",

      "Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) seropositive persons have a 3- to 5-fold higher risk of acquiring HIV, possibly because of HSV-2-induced inflammation and recruitment of susceptible immune cells to exposure sites. We hypothesized that cervical HSV-2 activation (ie, viral DNA shedding and/or ulcers) preceded HIV acquisition in the hormonal contraception and HIV cohort.\n",

Up to 5 cervical swabs bracketing first polymerase chain reaction detection of HIV DNA (the index visit) were selected (t-6months, t-3months, tindex, t+3months, t+6months). Women with HSV-2 immunoglobulin G+ before tindex were polymerase chain reaction tested for viral shedding. Self-reported and clinician-diagnosed ulcers were documented. Multivariable logistic regression, accounting for matching, estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at each visit.\n",

HSV-2 viral shedding was more common among HIV seroconverters than HIV-negative women (26% vs. 14%, P < 0.01). Shedding occurred around HIV acquisition (t-3months aOR, 2.7; 95% CI, 0.8 to 8.8; tindex aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.5; t+3months aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 6.6). Genital ulcers were reported more often among HIV seroconverters than HIV-negative women (13% vs. 7%; P = 0.06) and detection was after HIV acquisition (t+6months aOR, 14.5; 95% CI, 1.6 to 133.9).\n",

      "Declines in HIV incidence have been slower than expected during the roll-out of antiretroviral treatment (ART) services in sub-Saharan African populations suffering generalized epidemics. Using data from a population-based, open cohort HIV sero-survey (2004-13), we found evidence for initial reductions in sexual activity and multiple sexual partnerships, followed by increases during the period of ART scale-up in areas of high HIV prevalence in Manicaland, east Zimbabwe. Recent population-level increases in condom use were also recorded, but largely reflected high use by the rapidly growing proportion of HIV-infected individuals on treatment. Sexual risk behaviour increased in susceptible uninfected individuals and in untreated (and therefore more infectious) HIV-infected men, which may have slowed the decline in HIV incidence in this area. Intensified primary HIV prevention programmes, together with strengthened risk screening, referral, and support services following HIV testing, could help to maximize the impact of 'test-and-treat' programmes in reducing new infections.\n",
      "This review focuses on the pathophysiology of acute HIV infection (AHI) and related central nervous system (CNS) pathology, the clinical characteristics of neurologic complications of AHI, and the implications of the CNS reservoir and viral escape for HIV treatment and cure strategies.\n",
      "Recent studies in newly seroconverted populations show a high prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and cognitive dysfunction in AHI, even though these findings have been classically associated with chronic HIV infection. HIV cure strategies such as the \"shock and kill\" strategy are currently being studied \n",
      "Limited point of care diagnostic testing for AHI and delayed recognition of infection continue to lead to under-recognition and under-reporting of neurologic manifestations of AHI. AHI should be on the differential for a broad range of neurological conditions, from Bell's palsy, peripheral neuropathy, and aseptic meningitis, to more rare manifestations such as ADEM, AIDP, meningo-radiculitis, transverse myelitis, and brachial neuritis. Treatment for these conditions involves early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and then standard presentation-specific treatments. Current HIV cure strategies under investigation include bone marrow transplant, viral reservoir re-activation and eradication, and genome and epigenetic viral targeting. However, CNS penetration by HIV-1 occurs early on in the disease course with the establishment of the CNS viral reservoir and is an important limiting factor for these therapies.\n",
      "While large datasets of HIV-1 sequences are increasingly being generated, many studies rely on a single gene or fragment of the genome and few comparative studies across genes have been done. We performed genome-based and gene-specific Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to investigate how certain factors impact estimates of the infection dates in an acute HIV-1 infection cohort, RV217. In this cohort, HIV-1 diagnosis corresponded to the first RNA positive test and occurred a median of four days after the last negative test, allowing us to compare timing estimates using BEAST to a narrow window of infection. We analyzed HIV-1 sequences sampled one week, one month and six months after HIV-1 diagnosis in 39 individuals. We found that shared diversity and temporal signal was limited in acute infection, and insufficient to allow timing inferences in the shortest HIV-1 genes, thus dated phylogenies were primarily analyzed for env, gag, pol and near full-length genomes. There was no one best-fitting model across participants and genes, though relaxed molecular clocks (73% of best-fitting models) and the Bayesian skyline (49%) tended to be favored. For infections with single founders, the infection date was estimated to be around one week pre-diagnosis for env (IQR: 3-9 days) and gag (IQR: 5-9 days), whilst the genome placed it at a median of 10 days (IQR: 4-19). Multiply-founded infections proved problematic to date. Our ability to compare timing inferences to precise estimates of HIV-1 infection (within a week) highlights that molecular dating methods can be applied to within-host datasets from early infection. Nonetheless, our results also suggest caution when using uniform clock and population models or short genes with limited information content.\n",
      "Primary HIV infection (PHI) and subsequent chronic infection alter B-cell compartment. However, longitudinal analysis defining the dynamics of B-cell alterations are still limited. We longitudinally studied B-cell subsets in individuals followed for 1 year after PHI (n = 40). Treated and untreated chronic HIV infected (n = 56) and HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 58) were recruited as reference groups at the Manhiça District in Mozambique. B cells were analyzed by multicolor flow-cytometry. Anti-HIV humoral response and plasma cytokines were assessed by ELISA or Luminex-based technology. A generalized activation of B cells induced by HIV occurs early after infection and is characterized by increases in Activated and Tissue-like memory cells, decreases in IgM-IgD- (switched) and IgM-only B cells. These alterations remain mostly stable until chronic infection and are reverted in part by ART. In contrast, other parameters followed particular dynamics: PD-1 expression in memory cells decreases progressively during the first year of infection, Transitional B cells expand at month 3-4 after infection, and Marginal zone-like B cells show a late depletion. Plasmablasts expand 2 months after infection linked to plasma viral load and anti-p24 IgG3 responses. Most of well-defined changes induced by HIV in B-cell activation and memory subsets are readily observed after PHI, lasting until ART initiation. However, subsequent changes occur after sustained viral infection. These data indicate that HIV infection impacts B cells in several waves over time, and highlight that early treatment would result in beneficial effects on the B-cell compartment.\n",
      "In 2019, 38 million people lived with HIV-1 infection resulting in 690,000 deaths. Over 50% of this infection and its associated deaths occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa. The West African region is a known hotspot of the HIV-1 epidemic. There is a need to develop an HIV-1 vaccine if the HIV epidemic would be effectively controlled. Few protective cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes within the HIV-1 GAG (HIV_gagconsv) have been previously identified to be functionally conserved among the HIV-1 M group. These epitopes are currently the focus of universal HIV-1 T cell-based vaccine studies. However, these epitopes' phenotypic and genetic properties have not been observed in natural settings for HIV-1 strains circulating in the West African region. This information is critical as the usefulness of universal HIV-1 vaccines in the West African region depends on these epitopes' occurrence in strains circulating in the area. This study describes non-synonymous substitutions within and without HIV_gagconsv genes isolated from 10 infected Nigerians at the early stages of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, we analyzed these substitutions longitudinally in five infected individuals from the early stages of infection till after seroconversion. We identified three non-synonymous substitutions within HIV_gagconsv genes isolated from early HIV infected individuals. Fourteen and nineteen mutations outside the HIV_gagconsv were observed before and after seroconversion, respectively, while we found four mutations within the HIV_gagconsv. These substitutions include previously mapped CTL epitope immune escape mutants. CTL immune pressure likely leaves different footprints on HIV-1 GAG epitopes within and outside the HIV_gagconsv. This information is crucial for universal HIV-1 vaccine designs for use in the West African region.\n",
      "Individuals with HIV may present to the emergency department with HIV-related or HIV-unrelated conditions, toxicity associated with antiretroviral therapy or primary HIV infection (seroconversion). In individuals with HIV infection, central nervous system toxoplasmosis occurs from reactivation of disease, especially when the CD4+ count is <100 cells/μL, whereas in those taking immunosuppressive therapy, this can be either due to newly acquired or reactivated latent infection. It is a rare occurrence in immune-competent patients. Vertical transmission during pregnancy can manifest as congenital toxoplasmosis in the neonate and is often asymptomatic until the second or third decade of life when ocular lesions develop. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite \n",
      "Although monocytes and macrophages are key mediators of the innate immune system, the focus has largely been on the role of the adaptive immune system in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thus more attention and research work regarding the innate immune system-especially the role of monocytes and macrophages during early HIV-1 infection-is required. Blood monocytes and tissue macrophages are both susceptible targets of HIV-1 infection, and the early host response can determine whether the nature of the infection becomes pathogenic or not. For example, monocytes and macrophages can contribute to the HIV reservoir and viral persistence, and influence the initiation/extension of immune activation and chronic inflammation. Here the expansion of monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate and non-classical) provide an increased understanding of the crucial role they play in terms of chronic inflammation and also by increasing the risk of coagulation during HIV-1 infection. This review discusses the role of monocytes and macrophages during HIV-1 pathogenesis, starting from the early response to late dysregulation that occurs as a result of persistent immune activation and chronic inflammation. Such changes are also linked to downstream targets such as increased coagulation and the onset of cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "HIV prevalence data among pregnant women have been critical to estimating HIV trends and geographical patterns of HIV in many African countries. Although antenatal HIV prevalence data are known to be biased representations of HIV prevalence in the general population, mathematical models have made various adjustments to control for known sources of bias, including the effect of HIV on fertility, the age profile of pregnant women and sexual experience.\n",
      "We assessed whether assumptions about antenatal bias affect conclusions about trends and geographical variation in HIV prevalence, using simulated datasets generated by an agent-based model of HIV and fertility in South Africa. Results suggest that even when controlling for age and other previously-considered sources of bias, antenatal bias in South Africa has not been constant over time, and trends in bias differ substantially by age. Differences in the average duration of infection explain much of this variation. We propose an HIV duration-adjusted measure of antenatal bias that is more stable, which yields higher estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Simpler measures of antenatal bias, which are not age-adjusted, yield estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence that are too high in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and that are less precise. Antenatal bias in South Africa is substantially greater in urban areas than in rural areas.\n",
      "Age-standardized approaches to defining antenatal bias are likely to improve precision in model-based estimates, and further recency adjustments increase estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Incompletely adjusting for changing antenatal bias may explain why previous model estimates overstated the early HIV burden in South Africa. New assays to estimate the fraction of HIV-positive pregnant women who are recently infected could play an important role in better estimating antenatal bias.\n",
      "Understanding the earliest immune responses following HIV infection is critical to inform future vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we review recent prospective human studies in at-risk populations that have provided insight into immune responses during acute infection, including additional relevant data from non-human primate (NHP) studies. We discuss the timing, nature, and function of the diverse immune responses induced, the onset of immune dysfunction, and the effects of early anti-retroviral therapy administration. Treatment at onset of viremia mitigates peripheral T and B cell dysfunction, limits seroconversion, and enhances cellular antiviral immunity despite persistence of infection in lymphoid tissues. We highlight pertinent areas for future investigation, and how application of high-throughput technologies, alongside targeted NHP studies, may elucidate immune response features to target in novel preventions and cures.\n",

We re-engineered JC.53 cells to express GFP under regulation of HIV Tat and Rev. We characterize the new reporter cell line to show that TZM-gfp cells are equally susceptible to HIV infection, exhibit minimal background signal, and can report HIV infection in rare cells from a bulk population of experimentally-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages. We demonstrate the utility and sensitivity of the cells in detection of even a single HIV-positive macrophage by fluorescence-assisted correlative electron microscopy, using the GFP signal to guide imaging of HIV virions in primary co-culture. Finally, we used TZM-gfp cells for viral capture during co-culture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, showing that TZM-gfp can support outgrowth and analyses of patient-derived primary HIV-1 isolates.\n",

      "During Aug 2014-Feb 2015, we recruited a nationally representative sample of 1040 pairs of mother and infant aged 4-12 weeks at routine immunizations in 60 public health clinics using two stage sampling approach. Of these, 864 HIV exposed infants had DNA-PCR HIV test results available. We defined an HIV exposed infant if born to an HIV-positive mother with documented status or diagnosed at enrollment using rapid HIV tests. Dried Blood Spots samples from HIV exposed infants were tested for HIV. Interview data and laboratory results were collected on smartphones and uploaded to a central database. We measured MTCT prevalence at 4-12 weeks post-delivery and evaluated associations between infant HIV infection and maternal and infant characteristics including maternal treatment and infant prophylaxis. All statistical analyses accounted for the survey design.\n",
      "Based on the 864 HIV exposed infants with test results available, nationally weighted early MTCT measured at 4-12 weeks post-delivery was 1.74% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00%-3.01%). Overall, 62% of mothers started ART pre-conception, 33.6% during pregnancy, 1.2% post-delivery and 3.2% never received ART. Mothers who started ART before pregnancy and during pregnancy had low MTCT prevalence, 0.78% (95% CI: 0.31%-1.96%) and 0.98% (95% CI: 0.33%-2.91%), respectively. MTCT rose to 4.13% (95% CI: 0.54%-25.68%) when the mother started ART after delivery and to 11.62% (95% CI: 4.07%-28.96%) when she never received ART. The lowest MTCT of 0.76% (95% CI: 0.36% - 1.61%) was achieved when mother received ART and ARV prophylaxis within 72hrs for infant and highest 22.32% (95%CI: 2.78% -74.25%) when neither mother nor infant received ARVs. After adjusting for mother's age, maternal ART (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.29) and infant ARV prophylaxis (PR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10-0.998) remained strong predictors of HIV transmission.\n",

      "Learning one's HIV status through HIV testing services (HTS) is an essential step toward accessing treatment and linking to preventive services for those at high HIV risk. HTS may impact subsequent sexual behaviour, but the degree to which this varies by population or is true in the setting of contemporary HIV prevention activities is largely unknown.

We included studies that reported on at least one outcome (condom use [defined as the frequency of condom use or condom-protected sex], number of sex partners, HIV incidence, STI incidence/prevalence). We included studies that prospectively assessed outcomes and that fit into one of three categories: (1) those evaluating more versus less-intensive HTS, (2) those of populations receiving HTS versus not and (3) those evaluating outcomes after versus before HTS. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models.\n",
      "Of 29 980 studies screened, 76 studies were included. Thirty-eight studies were randomized controlled trials, 36 were cohort studies, one was quasi-experimental and one was a serial cross-sectional study. There was no significant difference in condom use among individuals receiving more-intensive HTS compared to less-intensive HTS (relative risk [RR]=1.03; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.07). Condom use was significantly higher after receiving HTS compared to before HTS for individuals newly diagnosed with HIV (RR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.36 to 1.99) and marginally significantly higher for individuals receiving an HIV-negative diagnosis (RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.62). Individuals receiving more-intensive HTS reported fewer sex partners at follow-up than those receiving less-intensive HTS, but the finding was not statistically significant (mean difference = -0.28; 95% CI: -3.66, 3.10).\n",

      "Increasing evidence points to a role for antibody-mediated effector functions in preventing and controlling HIV infection. However, less is known about how these antibody effector functions evolve following infection. Moreover, how the humoral immune response is naturally tuned to recruit the antiviral activity of the innate immune system, and the extent to which these functions aid in the control of infection, are poorly understood. Using plasma samples from 10 hyper-acute HIV-infected South African women, identified in Fiebig stage I (the FRESH cohort), systems serology was performed to evaluate the functional and biophysical properties of gp120-, gp41-, and p24- specific antibody responses during the first year of infection. Significant changes were observed in both the functional and biophysical characteristics of the humoral immune response following acute HIV infection. Antibody Fc-functionality increased over the course of infection, with increases in antibody-mediated phagocytosis, NK activation, and complement deposition occurring in an antigen-specific manner. Changes in both antibody subclass and antibody Fc-glycosylation drove the evolution of antibody effector activity, highlighting natural modifications in the humoral immune response that may enable the directed recruitment of the innate immune system to target and control HIV. Moreover, enhanced antibody functionality, particularly gp120-specific polyfunctionality, was tied to improvements in clinical course of infection, supporting a role for functional antibodies in viral control.\n",
      "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal and child mortality worldwide. Globally, 1.4 million pregnant women are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, the majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) have been associated with increased rates of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Acute HIV infection is associated with a rapid depletion of all three subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), ILC1s, ILC2s and ILC3s, which is not reversed by ART. ILCs have been found at the maternal-fetal interface and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral ILC frequencies and preterm birth. In our study of pregnant South African women with accurately dated pregnancies, we show that maternal HIV infection is associated with reduced levels of all three ILC subsets. Preterm birth was also associated with lower levels of all three ILC subsets in early pregnancy. ILC frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who experienced preterm birth. Moreover, ILC levels were reduced in pregnancies resulting in spontaneous onset of preterm labour and in extreme preterm birth (< 28 weeks gestation). Our findings suggest that reduced ILC frequencies may be a link between maternal HIV infection and preterm birth. In addition, ILC frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers for women who are at risk of delivering preterm.\n",

We used mixed methods to assess participants' understanding of the association between AHI and viral load, and its connection to sexual behavior at 8 weeks. While most participants understood key aspects of AHI, MI-intervention participants gave substantially more detailed descriptions of their understanding. Nearly all participants, regardless of study arm, understood that they were highly infectious and would be very likely to transmit HIV after unprotected sex during AHI. Our findings suggest that messages about AHI delivered during the period of AHI are likely beneficial for ensuring that those with AHI understand their level of infectiousness and its association with forward transmission.\n",

      "A hospital-based retrospective study was conducted in HIV-infected adult patients on antiretroviral (ART) from April to June 2017; secondary data were collected from review of clinical records. A total of 400 study participants selected through a systematic sampling technique and a pre-tested checklist was used to collect data from records of study subjects. The data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22.\n",

The overall of opportunistic infections (OIs) among HIV/AIDS patients on ART was 55.3%. The highest rates of OIs observed were oral candidacies 11.0%, followed by herpes zoster (10.8%) and tuberculosis (TB) (9.5%). The odds of having college and above educational levels were less likely to developed OIs compared to illiterate (AOR=0.007; 95% CI=0.053, 0.634). The odds of having OIs in WHO clinical stage I were less likely to have OIs compared to WHO clinical stage III and V (AOR=0.001; 95% CI=0.000, 0.015 and AOR=0.00; 95%CI=0.00 respectively).\n",

      "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal and child mortality worldwide. Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) increase the rate of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, limiting progress in prediction, prevention and treatment. While overall γδ T cell levels remain constant, acute HIV infection is associated with a depletion of the Vδ2 subset and an increase in the Vδ1 subset, which do not return to baseline with ART. γδ T cells have also been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral γδ T cell frequencies and preterm birth.\n",
      "Study participants were HIV positive (n = 47) and HIV negative (n = 45) women enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort study at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Women were enrolled in early pregnancy and gestational age was accurately determined by first trimester ultrasound scan. Peripheral blood samples were collected in each trimester and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated. Frequencies of γδ T cells, Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ γδ T cell subsets, and CCR6 chemokine receptor expression were determined by flow cytometry.\n",
      "Total γδ T cell levels were similar between HIV positive and HIV negative women throughout pregnancy. However, in each trimester maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced levels of the Vδ2+ subset and increased levels of the Vδ1+ subset, leading to a reversal of the Vδ1/Vδ2 ratio. Timing of ART initiation among HIV positive women did not affect levels of γδ T cells, the Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ subsets, or the Vδ1/Vδ2 ratio. Importantly, preterm birth was associated with lower total γδ T cell levels in early pregnancy and γδ T cell frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. Moreover, in the first trimester the proportion of Vδ1+ T cells that were CCR6+ was significantly reduced in HIV+ women and women who delivered preterm, resulting in the lowest proportion of CCR6+ Vδ1 T cells in HIV positive women who delivered preterm.\n",
      "Our findings suggest that altered γδ T cell frequencies may link maternal HIV infection and preterm birth. γδ T cell frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers to identify women at risk of delivering preterm.\n",

      "Primary outcome was survival, defined as time from scheduled end of chemoradiation therapy to death or last contact with patient. Nadir CD4 count was defined as lowest CD4 available before cancer diagnosis. Delta CD4 count was defined as improvement from nadir CD4 to CD4 at cancer diagnosis. Hazard ratio (HR) analyses were adjusted for presenting variables (age, baseline hemoglobin, cancer stage, and performance status) and treatment variables (chemotherapy cycles and radiation dose).\n",
      "Two hundred thirty-one patients were included in nadir CD4 analysis; 139 were included in delta CD4 analysis. Higher delta CD4 was significantly associated with reduced mortality after adjusting for presenting and treatment variables (CD4 100-249: HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.95; CD4 ≥250: HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20 to 1.02). Higher nadir CD4 showed a trend toward reduced mortality after adjusting for presenting and treatment variables (HR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.06).\n",
      "Higher delta CD4 (greater improvement from nadir CD4 to CD4 at cervical cancer diagnosis) is significantly associated with lower mortality. Although not statistically significant, data suggest that higher nadir CD4 may reduce mortality. These results reinforce the importance of early HIV diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy initiation, as their effects influence cervical cancer outcomes years later.\n",

The intervention consisted of enhanced quarterly counseling on HIV risk reduction, couple communication, family planning and nutrition delivered by study counselors through up to 24 months post-partum. Control participants received repeat standard post-test counseling. Qualitative data were collected from intervention women participants, counsellors and midwives at baseline, midline and end of the study through 18 focus group discussions and 44 key informant interviews. Data analysis followed a thematic approach using framework analysis and a matrix-based system for organizing, reducing, and synthesizing data.\n",
      "At baseline, FGD participants mentioned multiple sexual partners and lack of condom use as the main risks for pregnant and lactating women to acquire HIV. The main reasons for having multiple sexual partners were 1) the cultural practice not to have sex in the late pre-natal and early post-natal period; 2) increased sexual desire during pregnancy; 3) alcohol abuse; 4) poverty; and 5) conflict in couples. Consistent condom use at baseline was limited due to lack of knowledge and low acceptance of condom use in couples. The majority of intervention participants enrolled as couples felt enhanced counselling improved understanding, faithfulness, mutual support and appreciation within their couple. Another benefit mentioned by participants was improvement of couple communication and negotiation, as well as daily decision-making around sexual needs, family planning and condom use. Participants stressed the importance of providing counselling services to all couples.\n",

Patients with TB co-infection, with anemia, having a high liver abnormality score and patients who reported many sexual partners, had a significant increase in the intensities of immunological deterioration transitions. On the other hand, having high weight, higher education level, higher quality of life score, having high RBC parameters, high granulocyte component scores and high mononuclear component scores, significantly increased the intensities of immunological recovery transitions.\n",

      "South Africa (SA) has the most people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) globally and prevalent alcohol use. Beliefs that mixing alcohol and antiretroviral therapy (ART) can lead to adverse reactions may promote ART nonadherence. Healthcare providers (n = 11) and patients (n = 19) recruited from primary HIV and substance use care in SA described their messages, beliefs, and behaviors around simultaneous use of alcohol and ART. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis: (1) most providers indicated a message shift to reflect harm reduction principles: PLWH should manage alcohol use but not let it interfere with taking ART; however, (2) patients recalled conflicting messages from their providers and some displayed interactive toxicity beliefs and behaviors. Despite progress demonstrated by 2016 national adherence guidelines and shifted provider messaging, interactive toxicity beliefs remain a barrier to ART adherence.

Positive influences are: (a) behavioral strategies supporting adherence; (b) preserving health through adherence; (c) support from others; and (d) motivating effect of adherence monitoring. \"De-stabilizing experiences\" (mobility, loss, pregnancy) as barriers are posited to impact adherence indirectly through intervening consequences (e.g. exacerbation of poverty). Positive influences overlap substantially with adherence facilitators described for later-stage adherers in previous research. Adherence support strategies and interventions effective for persons initiating ART later in HIV disease are likely also to be helpful to individuals beginning treatment immediately upon confirmation of infection. De-stabilizing experiences merit additional investigation across varying populations.\n",

A single HIV screening test was performed at centralized laboratories in Zambia and South Africa (all participants, all visits). Additional testing was performed at the HPTN Laboratory Center using antigen/antibody screening tests, a discriminatory test and an HIV RNA test. This testing was performed to investigate cases with discordant test results and confirm incident HIV infections.\n",
      "HIV testing identified 978 seroconverter cases. This included 28 cases where the participant had acute HIV infection at the first HIV-positive visit. Investigations of cases with discordant test results identified cases where there was a participant or sample error (mixups). Seroreverter cases (errors where status changed from HIV infected to HIV uninfected, 0.4% of all cases) were excluded from the primary endpoint analysis. Statistical analysis demonstrated that exclusion of those cases improved the accuracy of HIV incidence estimates.\n",
      "This report demonstrates that the streamlined, algorithmic approach effectively identified HIV infections in this large cluster-randomized trial. Longitudinal HIV testing (all participants, all visits) and quality control testing provided useful data on the frequency of errors and provided more accurate data for HIV incidence estimates.\n",
      "Accurate methods for determining the duration of HIV infection at the individual level are valuable in many settings, including many critical research studies and in clinical practice (especially for acute infection). Since first published in 2003, the 'Fiebig staging system' has been used as the primary way of classifying early HIV infection into five sequential stages based on HIV test result patterns in newly diagnosed individuals. However, Fiebig stages can only be assigned to individuals who produce both a negative and a positive test result on the same day, on specific pairs of tests of varying 'sensitivity'. Further, in the past 16 years HIV-testing technology has evolved substantially, and three of the five key assays used to define Fiebig stages are no longer widely used. To address these limitations, we developed an improved and more general framework for estimating the duration of HIV infection by interpreting any combination of diagnostic test results, whether obtained on single or multiple days, into an estimated date of detectable infection, or EDDI. A key advantage of the EDDI method over Fiebig staging is that it allows for the generation of a point estimate, as well as an associated credibility interval for the date of first detectable infection, for any person who has at least one positive and one negative HIV test of any kind. The tests do not have to be run on the same day; they do not have to be run during the acute phase of infection and the method does not rely on any special pairing of tests to define 'stages' of infection. The size of the interval surrounding the EDDI (and therefore the precision of the estimate itself) depends largely on the length of time between negative and positive tests. The EDDI approach is also flexible, seamlessly incorporating any assay for which there is a reasonable diagnostic delay estimate. An open-source, free online tool includes a user-updatable curated database of published diagnostic delays. HIV diagnostics have evolved tremendously since that original publication more than 15 years ago, and it is time to similarly evolve the methods used to estimate timing of infection. The EDDI method is a flexible and rigorous way to estimate the timing of HIV infection in a continuously evolving diagnostic landscape.\n",
      "Renal dysfunctions are major predictors of co-morbidities and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Unconventional T cells have been shown to regulate kidney functions. However, there is dearth of information on the effect of HIV-associated nephropathies on γδ and DN T cells. It is also not clear whether γδ T cell perturbations observed during the early stages of HIV infection occur before immune activation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between creatinine and urea on the number of unconventional T cells in HIV-infected individuals at the early and chronic stages of infection. Persons in the chronic stage of infection were divided into treatment naïve and exposed groups. Treatment exposed individuals were further subdivided into groups with undetectable and detectable HIV-1RNA in their blood. Creatinine and urea levels were significantly higher among persons in the early HIV infection compared with the other groups. Proportions of γδ T, γδ + CD8, γδ + CD16 cells were also significantly reduced in the early stage of HIV infection (P < .01). Markers of immune activation, CD4 + HLA-DR and CD8 + HLA-DR, were also significantly reduced during early HIV infection (P < .01). Taken together, our findings suggest that high levels of renal markers as well as reduced proportions of gamma delta T cells are associated with the early stages of HIV infection. This event likely occurs before systemic immune activation reaches peak levels. This study provides evidence for the need for early HIV infection diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "Most HIV-1 infected individuals do not know their infection dates. Precise infection timing is crucial information for studies that document transmission networks or drug levels at infection. To improve infection timing, we used the prospective RV217 cohort where the window when plasma viremia becomes detectable is narrow: the last negative visit occurred a median of four days before the first detectable HIV-1 viremia with an RNA test, referred below as diagnosis. We sequenced 1,280 HIV-1 genomes from 39 participants at a median of 4, 32 and 170 days post-diagnosis. HIV-1 infections were dated by using sequence-based methods and a viral load regression method. Bayesian coalescent and viral load regression estimated that infections occurred a median of 6 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 9-3 and 11-4 days prior, respectively). Poisson-Fitter, which analyzes the distribution of hamming distances among sequences, estimated a median of 7 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 15-4 days) based on sequences sampled 4 days post-diagnosis, but it did not yield plausible results using sequences sampled at 32 days. Fourteen participants reported a high-risk exposure event at a median of 8 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 12 to 6 days prior). These different methods concurred that HIV-1 infection occurred about a week before detectable viremia, corresponding to 20 days (IQR: 34-15 days) before peak viral load. Together, our methods comparison helps define a framework for future dating studies in early HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "Comparison of two models for estimating residual transfusion transmission risk by NAT screened window period (WP) donations in South African repeat donors gave identical results for HIV but not for HBV. In order to understand discrepant HBV modelling outcomes, the values of input parameters in three HBV WP risk models were reviewed and subsequently applied to the same South African screening data generated by HBsAg PRISM and two NAT assays (Ultrio and Ultrio Plus). Two of the models were also compared using individual donation (ID)-NAT screening data from different geographical regions.\n",
      "Values of input parameters were derived from two published data sources and used in three risk models [(1) the incidence rate-WP risk day equivalent model, (2) the NAT yield WP ratio model and (3) the anti-HBc-negative HBsAg yield period ratio model] and subsequently applied to the same ID-NAT screening data.\n",
      "The HBV WP transmission risk in South African repeat donations during a one-year Ultrio Plus NAT screening period was estimated as 22, 43 and 17 per million, respectively, for the three models, as compared to 56, 117 and 48 per million for HBsAg PRISM screening. The approximate two-fold higher estimate calculated with the NAT yield WP ratio model was corroborated in repeat donations from three of four regions in a multi-regional study. When another set of model input values (with shorter viraemia periods and a higher proportion of acute occult infections) was applied to the South African screening data, the relative difference in risk estimates between the three models became smaller.\n",
      "Window period risk modelling for HBV is more complex than for HIV. Multiple factors affect the modelling outcomes. These include the values used for the length of transient HBsAg and HBV-DNA-positive phases, the proportion of acute occult and vaccine breakthrough infections and the assumption of random appearance of donors throughout the entire acute resolving infection phase. A substantial proportion of HBV WP NAT yields have very low viral load and lack donor follow-up data calling into question their definitive classification into the early acute (infectious) replication stage. Since these possible WP NAT yields most highly impact the NAT yield WP ratio model, we recommend relying on the more conservative estimates of the incidence rate-WP risk day equivalent model.\n",
      "Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell loss in chronic HIV-1 infection is a significant insult to antimicrobial immune defenses. Here we investigate the response of MAIT cells during acute HIV-1 infection utilizing the RV217 cohort with paired longitudinal pre- and post-infection samples. MAIT cells are activated and expand in blood and mucosa coincident with peak HIV-1 viremia, in a manner associated with emerging microbial translocation. This is followed by a phase with elevated function as viral replication is controlled to a set-point level, and later by their functional decline at the onset of chronic infection. Interestingly, enhanced innate-like pathways and characteristics develop progressively in MAIT cells during infection, in parallel with TCR repertoire alterations. These findings delineate the dynamic MAIT cell response to acute HIV-1 infection, and show how the MAIT compartment initially responds and expands with enhanced function, followed by progressive reprogramming away from TCR-dependent antibacterial responses towards innate-like functionality.\n",
      "Both neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) may be required for effective protection against HIV-1 infection. While there is extensive information on the targets of early neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses, much less is known about the targets of ADCC responses, which are more difficult to characterize. In four individuals recruited during acute HIV-infection, ADCC responses were detected 3-7 weeks prior to nAb responses. To determine the relative influence of ADCC and nAb responses on virus evolution, we performed an in-depth investigation of one individual (CAP63) who showed the highest nAb and ADCC responses. Both nAbs and ADCC antibodies targeted the V4 region of the Env, although there were some differences in epitope recognition. We identified accelerated viral evolution in this region concurrent with emergence of nAb activity, but not ADCC activity. Deep sequencing demonstrated that most nAb escape mutations were strongly selected for, however one nAb escape mutation that rendered the virus highly susceptible to autologous ADCC responses, was suppressed despite not affecting viral fitness. This escape mutation also rendered the virus more sensitive to autologous responses, as well as monoclonal antibodies targeting CD4-induced epitopes, compared to the wildtype virus. In conclusion, ADCC responses and nAbs in donor CAP63 recognized overlapping but unique epitopes in the V4 region, and while ADCC activity was present prior to nAbs, it did not drive viral evolution during this time. However, ADCC responses may select against nAb escape pathways that expose other common ADCC epitopes thereby restricting viral replication and expansion.\n",
      "There is a risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The aim of this study was to assess vertical transmission of HIV among pregnant women who initially had false-negative rapid HIV tests in South African antenatal care (ANC) clinics.\n",
      "Pregnant participants were enrolled in a diagnostic study that used nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to screen for early HIV infection among individuals who tested negative on rapid HIV tests used at the point-of-care (POC) facilities. Participants were enrolled from four ANC clinics in the Tshwane district of South Africa. All NAAT-positive participants were recalled to the clinics for further management. Vertical transmission was assessed among exposed infants whose HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were available.\n",
      "This study enrolled 8208 pregnant participants who tested negative on rapid HIV tests between 2013 and 2016. Their median age was 26 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-30). NAAT detected HIV infections in 0.6% (n = 49; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.5-0.8) of all study participants. The distribution of these infections among the four clinics ranged from 0.3%- 1.1%, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Forty-seven participants (95.9%) were successfully recalled and referred for antiretroviral treatment initiation as part of prevention of MTCT (PMTCT). Most women with newly diagnosed HIV infection presented for the first ANC visit in the second (61.9%, n = 26) and third (31.0%, n = 13) trimesters. HIV PCR results were available for thirty-two infants, three of whom tested positive (9.4%; 95% CI: 1.98-25.02).\n",
      "This study showed that supplemental HIV testing for pregnant women led to earlier linkage to the PMTCT programme. Inaccurate diagnosis of HIV infection at ANC clinics is likely to undermine the efforts of eliminating MTCT particularly in HIV-endemic settings.\n",
      "Knowledge of HIV status relies on accurate HIV testing, and is the first step towards access to HIV treatment and prevention programmes. Globally, HIV-status unawareness represents a significant challenge for achieving zero new HIV infections and deaths. In order to enhance knowledge of HIV status, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a testing strategy that includes the use of HIV-specific antibody point-of-care tests (POCT). These POCTs do not detect acute HIV infection, the stage of disease when viral load is highest but HIV antibodies are undetectable. Complicating things further, in the presence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), other currently available testing technologies, such as viral load detection for diagnosis of acute HIV infection, may yield false-negative results. In this scoping review, we evaluate the evidence and discuss alternative HIV testing algorithms that may mitigate diagnostic dilemmas in the setting of increased utilization of ART for immediate treatment and prevention of HIV infection.\n",
      "Missed acute HIV infection prevents people living with HIV (PLHIV) from accessing early treatment, increases likelihood of onward transmission, and allows for inappropriate initiation or continuation of PrEP, which may result in HIV drug resistance. While immediate ART is recommended for all PLHIV, studies have shown that starting ART in the setting of acute HIV infection may result in a delayed or complete absence of development of HIV-specific antibodies, posing a diagnostic challenge that is particularly pertinent to resource-limited, high HIV burden settings where HIV-antibody POCTs are standard of care. Similarly, ART used as PrEP or PEP may supress HIV RNA viral load, complicating current HIV testing algorithms in resource-wealthy settings where viral detection is included. As rollout of PrEP continues, HIV testing algorithms may need to be modified.\n",
      "With increasing use of PrEP and ART in acute infection we anticipate diagnostic challenges using currently available HIV testing strategies. Research and surveillance are needed to determine the most appropriate assays and optimal testing algorithms that are accurate, affordable and sustainable.\n",
      "The secondary analyses for correlates of risk of infection in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial implicated vaccine-induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses in the observed protection, highlighting the importance of assessing such responses in ongoing and future HIV-1 vaccine trials. However, \n",
      "In adults starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute infection, 2% of proviruses that persist on ART are genetically intact by sequence analysis. In contrast, a recent report in children treated early failed to detect sequence-intact proviruses. In another cohort of children treated early, we sought to detect and characterize proviral sequences after 6 to 9 years on suppressive ART. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from perinatally infected children from the Children with HIV Early antiRetroviral (CHER) study were analyzed. Nearly full-length proviral amplification and sequencing (NFL-PAS) were performed at one time point after 6 to 9 years on ART. Amplicons with large internal deletions were excluded (<9 kb). All amplicons of ≥9 kb were sequenced and analyzed through a bioinformatic pipeline to detect indels, frameshifts, or hypermutations that would render them defective. In eight children who started ART at a median age of 5.4 months (range, 2.0 to 11.1 months), 733 single NFL-PAS amplicons were generated. Of these, 534 (72.9%) had large internal deletions, 174 (23.7%) had hypermutations, 15 (1.4%) had small internal deletions, 3 (1.0%) had deletions in the packaging signal/major splice donor site, and 7 (1.0%) were sequence intact. These 7 intact sequences were from three children who initiated ART after 2.3 months of age, one of whom had two identical intact sequences, suggestive of a cell clone harboring a replication-competent provirus. No intact proviruses were detected in four children who initiated ART before 2.3 months of age. Rare, intact proviruses can be detected in children who initiate ART after 2.3 months of age and are probably, as in adults, maintained by clonal expansion of cells infected before ART initiation.\n",
      "Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to long-term viral suppression, reduces proviral reservoir size, and prolongs time to rebound. Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lifelong disease, diagnostic monitoring after confirmed infection is typically not performed; therefore, little is known about the impact of early initiation and long-term ART on the sensitivity of assays that detect HIV antibodies and viral nucleic acid in children and adolescents.\n",
      "Here we report 1 case of diagnosed and confirmed perinatal HIV-1C infection with longstanding viral suppression, who subsequently had a negative HIV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test, undetectable antibodies to HIV-1, and high CD4+ T cell count after 14 years of ART.\n",
      "The patient was diagnosed with HIV in 2002 at 1 and 2 months of age using DNA polymerase chain reaction. At 8 months old, his viral load was 1210 HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL and CD4 T cell count was 3768 cells/mm.\n",
      "At the age of 9 months, highly active antiretroviral therapy comprising of zidovudine, nevirapine, and lamivudine was initiated. The patient remained on this treatment for 14 years 11 months and was virally suppressed.\n",
      "At the age of 14 years 4 months, the participant decided to visit a local voluntary HIV testing center, where a rapid HIV test came out negative and the viral load was undetectable (<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). These results led to termination of ART which led to viral rebound within 9 months.\n",
      "As more people with early HIV infection initiate early ART in the context of \"Test and Treat all\" recommendations, aspects of this report may become more commonplace, with both clinical and public health implications. If the possibility of functional cure (or false-positive diagnosis) is being considered, decisions to terminate ART should be made cautiously and with expert guidance, and may benefit from highly sensitive quantification of the proviral reservoir.\n",
      "Implementation science (IS) occupies a critical place in HIV/AIDS research, reflected by a scientific track (\"Track E\") at the biannual International AIDS Conference. IS seeks to identify health delivery strategies that cost-effectively translate the efficacy of evidence-based interventions for HIV prevention, testing, and treatment into impact on HIV incidence, quality of life, and mortality.\n",
      "We reviewed the content of Track E, and other presentations relevant to IS, at the 22nd International AIDS Conference held in Amsterdam in 2018. We identified key findings and themes and made recommendations for areas where the field can be strengthened by the 2020 meeting.\n",
      "Trials of \"treat all\" strategies in Africa showed mixed evidence of effect. Innovations in HIV testing included expanding self-testing and index testing, which are reaching groups, such as men, where previously testing rates have been low. Adherence clubs and other innovations are being trialed to improve retention in care, with mixed findings. The implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention continues but with many challenges remaining in identifying implementation strategies that strengthen demand and support continuation.\n",
      "IS for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention continues to expand. IS for primary HIV prevention must be prioritized with a dearth of rigorous, intersectoral studies in this area. The weakness of routine data must be addressed. Costing and financing studies should form a stronger component of the conference agenda. Implementation scientists must continue to grapple with the methodological challenges posed by the real-world context for their research.\n",
      "Psychological morbidities concurrent with HIV have been the focus of considerable scientific investigations. However, researchers have largely overlooked HIV-related stress and resilience among women living with HIV in rural communities.\n",
      "This study explored the associations between psychological resilience and HIV-related stress among women living with HIV.\n",
      "The study was conducted in three randomly selected hospitals that provide primary HIV care in Niger state, Nigeria.\n",
      "A predictive cross-sectional design was used to describe the relationship between perceived stress and resilience among the study population.\n",
      "Out of 748 participants who completed the Connor-Davidson resilience scale and the perceived stress scale questionnaires, 676 returned the questionnaire in usable form. While the results showed moderate levels of perceived stress and a high level of psychological resilience, there was a significant and negative relationship between HIV-related stress and psychological resilience (r = -0.601, p = 0.001). Also, higher resilience was significantly associated with decreased perceived stress.\n",

      "Neurological disorders in HIV infection are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this paper is to provide a narrative overview of up to date information concerning neurological disorders affecting HIV infected persons in Africa.\n",
      "Seminal research concerning neurological disorders among HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa from prior to 2000 was combined with an in-depth search of PubMed to identify literature published from 2000 to 2017. The following Mesh terms were used. \"Nervous System Diseases\" \"HIV Infections\" and \"Africa South of the Sahara\" and \"Seizures\" or \"Spinal Cord Diseases\" or \"Peripheral Nervous System Diseases\" or \"AIDS Dementia Complex\" or \"Opportunistic Infections\" or \"Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome\" or \"Stroke\". Only those articles written in English were used. A total of 352 articles were identified, selected and reviewed and 180 were included in the study. These included case series, observational studies, interventional studies, guidelines and reviews with metanalyses. The author also included 15 publications on the subject covering the earlier phase of the HIV epidemic in Africa from 1987 to 1999 making a total of 195 references in the study. This was combined with extensive personal experience diagnosing and treating these neurological disorders.\n",
      "Neurological disorders were common, typically occurring in WHO stages III/IV. These were in three main categories: those arising from opportunistic processes mostly infections, direct HIV infection and autoimmunity. The most common were those arising from direct HIV infection occurring in >50%. These included HIV-associated neurocognitive dysfunction (HAND), neuropathy and myelopathy. Opportunistic infections occurred in >20% and frequently had a 6-9-month mortality rate of 60-70%. The main causes were cryptococcus, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and acute bacterial meningitis. Concurrent systemic tuberculosis occurred in almost 50%.\n",
      "Neurological disorders are common in HIV in Africa and the main CNS opportunistic infections result in high mortality rates. Strategies aimed at reducing their high burden, morbidity and mortality include early HIV diagnosis and anti-retroviral therapy (ART), screening and chemoprophylaxis of main opportunistic infections, improved clinical diagnosis and management and programme strengthening.\n",
      "It is frequently of epidemiological and/or clinical interest to estimate the date of HIV infection or time-since-infection of individuals. Yet, for over 15 years, the only widely-referenced infection dating algorithm that utilises diagnostic testing data to estimate time-since-infection has been the 'Fiebig staging' system. This defines a number of stages of early HIV infection through various standard combinations of contemporaneous discordant diagnostic results using tests of different sensitivity. To develop a new, more nuanced infection dating algorithm, we generalised the Fiebig approach to accommodate positive and negative diagnostic results generated on the same or different dates, and arbitrary current or future tests - as long as the test sensitivity is known. For this purpose, test sensitivity is the probability of a positive result as a function of time since infection.\n",
      "The present work outlines the analytical framework for infection date estimation using subject-level diagnostic testing histories, and data on test sensitivity. We introduce a publicly-available online HIV infection dating tool that implements this estimation method, bringing together 1) curatorship of HIV test performance data, and 2) infection date estimation functionality, to calculate plausible intervals within which infection likely became detectable for each individual. The midpoints of these intervals are interpreted as infection time 'point estimates' and referred to as Estimated Dates of Detectable Infection (EDDIs). The tool is designed for easy bulk processing of information (as may be appropriate for research studies) but can also be used for individual patients (such as in clinical practice).\n",
      "In many settings, including most research studies, detailed diagnostic testing data are routinely recorded, and can provide reasonably precise estimates of the timing of HIV infection. We present a simple logic to the interpretation of diagnostic testing histories into infection time estimates, either as a point estimate (EDDI) or an interval (earliest plausible to latest plausible dates of detectable infection), along with a publicly-accessible online tool that supports wide application of this logic.\n",
      "This tool, available at https://tools.incidence-estimation.org/idt/ , is readily updatable as test technology evolves, given the simple architecture of the system and its nature as an open source project.\n",
      "HIV infection is a growing public health problem in Sierra Leone and the wider West Africa region. The countrywide HIV prevalence was estimated at 1.7% (67,000 people), with less than 30% receiving life-saving ART in 2016. Thus, HIV-infected patients tend to present to health facilities late, with high mortality risk.\n",
      "We conducted a prospective study of HIV inpatients aged ≥15 years at Connaught Hospital in Freetown-the main referral hospital in Sierra Leone-from July through September 2017, to assess associated factors and predictors of HIV-related mortality.\n",
      "One hundred seventy-three HIV inpatients were included, accounting for 14.2% (173/1221) of all hospital admissions during the study period. The majority were female (59.5%, 70/173), median age was 34 years, with 51.4% (89/173) of them diagnosed with HIV infection for the first time during the current hospitalization. The most common admitting diagnoses were anemia (48%, 84/173), tuberculosis (24.3%, 42/173), pneumonia (17.3%, 30/173) and diarrheal illness (15.0%, 26/173). CD4 count was obtained in 64.7% (112/173) of patients, with median value of 87 cells/μL (IQR 25-266), and was further staged as severe immunosuppression: CD4 < 100 cells/μL (50%, 56/112); AIDS: CD4 < 200 cells/μL (69.6%, 78/112); and late-stage HIV disease: CD4 < 350 cells/μL (83%, 93/112). Fifty-two patients (30.1%, 52/173) died during hospitalization, 23% (12/52) of them within the first week. The leading causes of death were anemia (23.1%, 12/52), pneumonia (19.2%, 10/52), diarrheal illness (15.4%, 8/52) and tuberculosis (13.6%, 7/52). Neurological symptoms, i.e., loss of consciousness (p = 0.04) and focal limb weakness (p = 0.04); alcohol use (p = 0.01); jaundice (p = 0.02); cerebral toxoplasmosis (p = 0.01); and tuberculosis (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with mortality; however, only jaundice (AOR 0.11, 95% CI [0.02-0.65]; p = 0.01) emerged as an independent predictor of mortality.\n",
      "HIV-infected patients account for a substantial proportion of admissions at Connaught Hospital, with a high morbidity and in-hospital mortality burden. These findings necessitate the implementation of specific measures to enhance early HIV diagnosis and expand treatment access to all HIV-infected patients in Sierra Leone.\n",
      "Prevention of new HIV infections is a critical public health issue. The highest HIV testing gaps are in men, adolescents 15-19 years old, and adults 40 years and older. Community-based HIV testing services (HTS) can contribute to increased testing coverage and early HIV diagnosis, with HIV self-testing (HIVST) strategies showing promise. Community-based strategies, however, are resource intensive, costly and not widely implemented. A community-led approach to health interventions involves supporting communities to plan and implement solutions to improve their health. This trial aims to determine if community-led delivery of HIVST can improve HIV testing uptake, ART initiation, and broader social outcomes in rural Malawi.\n",
      "The trial uses a parallel arm, cluster-randomised design with group village heads (GVH) and their defined catchment areas randomised (1:1) to community-led HIVST or continue with the standard of the care (SOC). As part of the intervention, informal community health cadres are supported to plan and implement a seven-day HIVST campaign linked to HIV treatment and prevention. Approximately 12 months after the initial campaign, intervention GVHs are randomised to lead a repeat HIVST campaign. The primary outcome includes the proportion of adolescents 15-19 years old who have tested for HIV in their lifetime. Secondary outcomes include recent testing in adults 40 years and older and men; ART initiation; knowledge of HIV prevention; and HIV testing stigma. Outcomes will be measured through cross-sectional surveys and clinic registers. Economic evaluation will determine the cost per person tested, cost per person diagnosed, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio.\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to assess the effectiveness of community-led HTS, which has only recently been enabled by the introduction of HIVST. Community-led delivery of HIVST is a promising new strategy for providing periodic HIV testing to support HIV prevention in rural communities. Further, introduction of HIVST through a community-led framework seems particularly apt, with control over healthcare concurrently devolved to individuals and communities.\n",

We sought to understand non-attendance at scheduled follow-up study visits up to 18 months, and for the 18-month infant HIV test amongst a nationally representative sample of HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) infants from a high HIV-prevalence African setting.\n",
      "Secondary analysis of data drawn from a nationally representative observational cohort study (conducted during October 2012 to September 2014) of HEU infants and their primary caregivers was undertaken. Participants were eligible (N = 2650) if they were 4-8 weeks old and HEU at enrolment. All enrolled infants were followed up every 3 months up to 18 months. Each follow-up visit was scheduled to coincide with each child's routine health visit, where possible. The denominator at each time point comprised HEU infants who were alive and HIV-free at the previous visit. We assessed baseline maternal and early HIV care characteristics associated with the frequency of 'Missed visits' (MV-frequency), using a negative binomial regression model adjusting for the follow-up time in the study, and associated with missed visits at 18 months (18-month MV) using a logistic regression model.\n",
      "The proportion of eligible infants with MV was lowest at 3 months (32.7%) and 18 months (31.0%) and highest at 12 months (37.6%). HIV-positive mothers not on triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) by 6-weeks postpartum had a significantly increased occurrence rate of 'MV-frequency' (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.4), p < 0.0001). Compared to those mothers with ART, these mothers also increased the risk of '18-month-MV' (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3 (CI, 1.1-1.6), p = 0.006). Unknown infant nevirapine-intake status increased the rate of 'MV-frequency' (p = 0.02). Mothers > 24 years had a significantly reduced rate of 'MV-frequency' (p ≤ 0.01) and risk of '18-month-MV' (p < 0.01) compared to younger women. Shorter travel time to health facility lowered the occurrence of 'MV-frequency' (p ≤ 0.004).\n",
      "Late initiation of maternal ART and infant prophylaxis under the Option- A policy and extended travel time to clinics (measured at 6 weeks postpartum), contributed to higher postnatal MV rates. Mothers older than 24 years had lower MV rates. Targeted interventions may be needed during the current PMTCT Option B+ (lifelong ART to pregnant and lactating women at HIV diagnosis) to circumvent these risk factors and reduce missed visits during HIV-care.\n",

      "the average age of students was 22.5 years, with the majority of the students being male (57%). Just over half the students sampled, reported being sexually active (51.8%). One hundred and sixty four (75%) reported that they had one sexual partner and fifty-six (25%) two or more sexual partners in the past year. Sixty-six percent had used condoms during their last sexual encounter. The acceptability of HIVST was high (81.4%) and 66.1% of students stated that they would confirm the self-test at a local health facility. The knowledge about the importance of the self-test (OR 5.02; 95% CI:1.33-18.88; p=0.017), the perception that counseling pre and post-test were important (OR 2.91; 95% CI:1.63-5.19; p < 0.0001) and the willingness to realize the test with a partner (OR 2.46; 95% CI:1.43-4.23; p=0.034) were factors associated with HIVST.\n",
      "the acceptability of HIVST was high and therefore its implementation is feasible in our country. However, prior to implementation, additional factors such as cost; access of HIVST; false reassurance of the test; missed early infections in the window period, limited counseling and linkage to care options, need to be considered.\n",
      "Despite extensive research on the mechanisms of HLA-mediated immune control of HIV-1 pathogenesis, it is clear that much remains to be discovered, as exemplified by protective HLA alleles like HLA-B*81 which are associated with profound protection from CD4+ T cell decline without robust control of early plasma viremia. Here, we report on additional HLA class I (B*1401, B*57, B*5801, as well as B*81), and HLA class II (DQB1*02 and DRB1*15) alleles that display discordant virological and immunological phenotypes in a Zambian early infection cohort. HLA class I alleles of this nature were also associated with enhanced immune responses to conserved epitopes in Gag. Furthermore, these HLA class I alleles were associated with reduced levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the plasma during acute infection. Elevated LPS levels measured early in infection predicted accelerated CD4+ T cell decline, as well as immune activation and exhaustion. Taken together, these data suggest novel mechanisms for HLA-mediated immune control of HIV-1 pathogenesis that do not necessarily involve significant control of early viremia and point to microbial translocation as a direct driver of HIV-1 pathogenesis rather than simply a consequence.\n",
      "Cytolytic CD4+ T cells play a prominent role in chronic viral infection. CD4+ CTLs clones specific for HIV-1 Nef and Gag are capable of killing HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Additionally, HIV-specific cytolytic CD4+ T cell responses in acute HIV infection are predictive of disease progression. CD57 expression on CD4s identifies cytolytic cells. These cells were dramatically increased in chronic HIV infection. CD57 expression correlated with cytolytic granules, granzyme B and perforin expression. They express lower CCR5 compared to CD57- cells, have less HIV total DNA, and were a minor component of the HIV reservoir. A small percentage of CD57+ CD4+ CTLs from EC were HIV-specific, could upregulate IFNγ with Gag peptide stimulation, express cytolytic granule markers and maintain Tbet\n",

This is an analytical cross-sectional study using routine DBS sample data from the NMRL in Harare, Zimbabwe, between January and December 2017.A total of 34 950 DBS samples were received at the NMRL. Of these, 1291(4%) were rejected. Reasons for rejection were insufficient specimen volume (72%), missing request form (11%), missing sample (6%), cross-contamination (6%), mismatch of information (4%) and clotted sample (1%). Samples collected from clinics/rural health facilities were five times more likely to be rejected compared to those from a central hospital. Rejection rates were above the set target of <2%. The reasons for rejection were 'pre-analytical' errors including labelling errors, missing or inconsistent data, and insufficient blood collected. Samples collected at primary healthcare facilities had higher rejection rates.\n",
      "Infants infected during pregnancy or while breastfeeding requires early HIV diagnosis at 6 weeks after birth to identify HIV infection and timely treatment. The objective of this work was to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of HIV among HIV exposed infants in the Tigray regional state, Northern Ethiopia.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 exposed infants born to HIV seropositive mothers from September 01 to December 30, 2016. Convenient consecutive sampling technique was employed to enroll HIV exposed infants from age 6 weeks to 18 months attending prevention of mother to child transmission (PMCT) clinic at Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) site facility in Tigray, Ethiopia. Sociodemographic data and associated risk factors were collected using a structured questionnaire. Dried Blood Spot (DBS) samples were collected from each infant and transported by post to Tigray Health Research Institute to detect HIV infection using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Data were entered into EPI Info version 7, exported and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. p-value less than 0.05 was deemed to be statistically significant by Fisher's exact test.\n",
      "Three hundred forty infants (175 males, 165 females) met the criteria for selection during the completion of the study and the overall HIV prevalence was found to be 2.1% (n = 7). The majority of infants were from urban areas (n = 246, 72.4%). 45.5% (5/11, p = 0.001) infants were without ARV prophylaxis, 60% (3/5, p = 0.001) infants born to mothers who did not take maternal PMTCT intervention, 43% (3/7, p = 0.001) infants born to mothers who were not enrolled to ART care, and 6.1% (4/66, p = 0.029) infants of unmarried mothers showed statistically significant difference.\n",
      "The overall prevalence of HIV among exposed infants was high but lower than the Millennium Development Goal targets. In order to eliminate the mother to child HIV transmission (MTCT) ARV prophylaxis in infants must be strengthened, and enrollment of HIV positive pregnant women to PMTCT and ART care and treatment is needed.\n",
      "African studies have reported high rates of loss to follow up (LTFU) among children in HIV care and treatment centres. Factors associated with LTFU may vary across populations. Few studies have been conducted among HIV infected children in care in rural areas of Kenya.\n",
      "this involved children aged less than 15 years on follow up at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital HIV clinic from January 2010 to December 2015. We obtained sociodemographic and clinical information from patient files and electronic databases. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify factors predictive of LTFU.\n",
      "a total of 261 HIV-infected children were followed up. The mean age was 10.0 years (IQR, 7-13) and median CD4 count of 582cells/ul (IQR 314-984). By December 2015, 171 children (65.5%) remained in active care, 32 (12.3%) transferred out, 13 (5%) died, while 45 (17.2%) were classified as LTFU. Out of the 45 children presumed as LTFU, we traced 44 out of the 45 children (98%) and found that their actual current status was as follows: 33 of the 44 children (75.0%) had dropped out of care (true LTFU). Factors strongly predictive of LTFU included low caregiver level of education (HR 2.3, 1.9-3.9, P = 0.001), WHO stage I and II at enrolment (HR 1.6, 1.4-2.1, P = 0.05).\n",
      "LTFU of HIV infected children was common with an incidence of 32.9 per 1000 child years and occurred early in treatment and risk factors included poverty, low caregiver education, male child and early HIV disease stage.\n",
      "HIV-exposed very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (≤ 1500 g) are considered at high risk of peripartum mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT). In the past, they received formula to prevent breast milk related HIV transmission. This denied them the benefits of breast milk, thus exposing the infant to the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). From 2010, 'raw' mother's own milk (rMOM) has been recommended for term infants whose mothers' received antenatal antiretroviral therapy (ART). At the same time, the infant received antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis as per the National Prevention of MTCT programme.\n",
      "To determine the cumulative incidence of peripartum HIV infection by 4-6 weeks of age in HIV-exposed VLBW infants, who received rMOM and infant ARV prophylaxis.\n",
      "A retrospective, observational audit over 3 years at a single institution was undertaken. The study population comprised HIV-exposed VLBW infants who received both nevirapine prophylaxis and rMOM from birth until discharge. A positive HIV-PCR by 4-6 weeks of life was used to confirm maternal to infant HIV transmission.\n",
      "Of the 80 eligible infants admitted between 2010 and 2013, 63 (79%) were exposed to antenatal ART. Seventy-eight (97.5%) tested HIV-PCR negative at 4-6 weeks. Of the two infants who tested positive, both presented with features of an acute HIV infection. The absence of MTCT in the remaining 78 infants given ARV prophylaxis and rMOM suggests that rMOM is an unlikely source of infection in the two infected infants.\n",
      "rMOM, in the presence of infant prophylaxis, was a safe feeding option for HIV-exposed VLBW infants. It should be strongly considered for these infants, as rMOM likely provides additional maternal and child benefits.\n",
      "HIV diagnosis is a critical step in linking HIV-infected individuals to care and treatment and linking HIV-uninfected persons to prevention services. However, the uptake of HIV testing remains low in many countries. HIV self-screening (HIVSS) is acceptable to adults, but there is limited data on HIVSS feasibility in community programmes. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of HIVSS in South Africa.\n",
      "We conducted a prospective study that enrolled participants through mobile site, homebased, workplace and sex worker programmes in two townships from May to November 2017. Following an information session on HIVSS, interested participants were offered one of three methods of HIVSS testing: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised. Participants who opted for unsupervised testing and those who tested HIV positive after semi- or supervised HIVSS were followed up telephonically or with a home visit one week after receipt of the test kit to confirm results and linkages to care. Follow-up visits were concluded when the participant indicated that they had used the kit or had accessed a confirmatory HIV test.\n",
      "Of the 2061 people approached, 88.2% (1818/2061) received HIV testing information. Of this group, 89% (1618/1818) were enrolled in the study and 70.0% (1133/1618) were tested for HIV with the kit. The median age was 28 (IQR:23-33) years with an even gender distribution. Of those enrolled, 43.0% (696/1618) were identified through homebased outreach, 42.5% (687/1618) through mobile sites, 7.3% (118/1618) at their workplace and 7.2% (117/1618) from sex worker programmes. A total of 68.7% (1110/1616) selected unsupervised HIVSS, whereas 6.3% (101/1616) opted for semi-supervised and 25.0% ((405/1616) chose supervised HIVSS. Overall, the HIV prevalence using the HIVSS test was 8.2% (93/1129). Of those newly diagnosed with HIV, 16% (12/75) were initiated on ART. Almost half (48.0%; 543/1131) of those tested were linked to a primary HIV test as follows: supervised (85.2%; 336/394); semi-supervised (93.8%; 91/97) and unsupervised (18.1%; 116/640).\n",
      "Unsupervised HIVSS was by far the most selected and utilised HIVSS method. Linkages to primary and confirmatory testing for the unsupervised HIVSS and further care were low, despite home visits and telephonic reminders.\n",
      "Knowledge of the time of HIV-1 infection and the multiplicity of viruses that establish HIV-1 infection is crucial for the in-depth analysis of clinical prevention efficacy trial outcomes. Better estimation methods would improve the ability to characterize immunological and genetic sequence correlates of efficacy within preventive efficacy trials of HIV-1 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. We developed new methods for infection timing and multiplicity estimation using maximum likelihood estimators that shift and scale (calibrate) estimates by fitting true infection times and founder virus multiplicities to a linear regression model with independent variables defined by data on HIV-1 sequences, viral load, diagnostics, and sequence alignment statistics. Using Poisson models of measured mutation counts and phylogenetic trees, we analyzed longitudinal HIV-1 sequence data together with diagnostic and viral load data from the RV217 and CAPRISA 002 acute HIV-1 infection cohort studies. We used leave-one-out cross validation to evaluate the prediction error of these calibrated estimators versus that of existing estimators and found that both infection time and founder multiplicity can be estimated with improved accuracy and precision by calibration. Calibration considerably improved all estimators of time since HIV-1 infection, in terms of reducing bias to near zero and reducing root mean squared error (RMSE) to 5-10 days for sequences collected 1-2 months after infection. The calibration of multiplicity assessments yielded strong improvements with accurate predictions (ROC-AUC above 0.85) in all cases. These results have not yet been validated on external data, and the best-fitting models are likely to be less robust than simpler models to variation in sequencing conditions. For all evaluated models, these results demonstrate the value of calibration for improved estimation of founder multiplicity and of time since HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "Central nervous system infections are an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in high HIV-prevalence settings of Africa. We evaluated the epidemiology of pediatric meningitis in Botswana during the rollout of antiretroviral therapy, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) vaccine.\n",
      "We performed a cross-sectional study of children (<15 years old) evaluated for meningitis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination from 2000 to 2015, with complete national records for 2013-2014. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of microbiologically confirmed and culture-negative meningitis were described and incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae and cryptococcal meningitis was estimated for 2013-2014.\n",
      "A total of 6796 unique cases were identified. Median age was 1 year [interquartile range 0-3]; 10.4% (435/4186) of children with available HIV-related records were known HIV-infected. Overall, 30.4% (2067/6796) had abnormal CSF findings (positive microbiologic testing or CSF pleocytosis). Ten percent (651/6796) had a confirmed microbiologic diagnosis; including 26.9% (175/651) Cryptococcus, 18.9% (123/651) S. pneumoniae, 20.3% (132/651) H. influenzae and 1.1% (7/651) Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During 2013-2014, national cryptococcal meningitis incidence was 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.1) and pneumococcal meningitis incidence 0.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.3), with no HiB meningitis diagnosed.\n",
      "Following HiB vaccination, a marked decline in microbiologically confirmed cases of H. influenzae meningitis occurred. Cryptococcal meningitis remains the most common confirmed etiology, demonstrating gaps in prevention-of-mother-to-child transmission and early HIV diagnosis. The high proportion of abnormal CSF samples with no microbiologic diagnosis highlights limitation in available diagnostics.\n",
      "Rates of HIV-1 superinfection, re-infection with a genetically distinct virus despite HIV-1 specific immune responses, vary in different risk populations. We previously found the rates of superinfection were similar to primary HIV infection (PHI) in a Zambian heterosexual transmission cohort. Here, we conduct a similar analysis of 47 HIV-positive Zambians from an acute infection cohort with more frequent follow-up, all infected by non-spousal partners. We identified only one case of superinfection in the first two years, significantly fewer than in our previous study, which was likely due to increased counseling during acute infection and an overall population-wide decline in factors associated with HIV transmission. The predominant virus detected after superinfection was a recombinant of the transmitted founder (TF) and the superinfecting strain. The superinfected individual mounted a neutralizing antibody response to the primary TF virus, which remained TF-specific over time and even after superinfection, did not neutralize the superinfecting variant.\n",
      "Point of-care (POC) HIV-1 RNA tests which are accurate and easy to use with limited infrastructure are needed in resource-limited settings (RLS). We systematically reviewed evidence of POC test performance compared to laboratory-based HIV-1 RNA assays and the potential utility of these tests for diagnosis and care in RLS.\n",
      "Studies published up to July 2018 were identified by a search of PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies evaluating the use of POC HIV-1 RNA testing for early infant diagnosis (EID), acute HIV infection (AHI) diagnosis, or viral load monitoring (VL), compared to centralized testing, were included. Separate search strategies were used for each testing objective.\n",
      "197 abstracts were screened and 34 full-text articles were assessed, of which 32 met inclusion criteria. Thirty studies evaluated performance and diagnostic accuracy of POC tests compared to standard reference tests. Two of the thirty and two additional studies with no comparative testing reported on clinical utility of POC results. Five different POC tests (Cepheid GeneXpert HIV-1 Quantitative and Qualitative assays, Alere q HIV-1/2 Detect, SAMBA, Liat HIV Quant and Aptima HIV-1 Quant) were used in 21 studies of VL, 11 of EID and 2 of AHI. POC tests were easy to use, had rapid turnaround times, and comparable accuracy and precision to reference technologies. Sensitivity and specificity were high for EID and AHI but lower for VL. For VL, lower sensitivity was reported for whole blood and dried blood spots compared to plasma samples. Reported error rates for Cepheid GeneXpert Qual (2.0%-5.0%), GeneXpert Quant (2.5%-17.0%) and Alere q HIV-1/2 Detect (3.1%-11.0%) were higher than in WHO prequalification reports. Most errors resolved with retesting; however, inadequate sample volumes often precluded repeat testing. Only two studies used POC results for clinical management, one for EID and another for VL. POC EID resulted in shorter time-to-result, rapid ART initiation, and better retention in care compared to centralised testing.\n",
      "Performance of POC HIV-1 RNA tests is comparable to reference assays, and have potential to improve patient outcomes. Additional studies on implementation in limited-resources settings are needed.\n",
      "Little is known about the genotypic make-up of HIV-1 DNA genomes during the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA in four women identified during acute HIV-1 infection in Durban, South Africa, through twice-weekly screening of high-risk participants. In contrast to chronically HIV-1-infected patients, we found that at the earliest phases of infection in these four participants, the majority of viral DNA genomes are intact, lack APOBEC-3G/F-associated hypermutations, have limited genome truncations, and over one year show little indication of cytotoxic T cell-driven immune selections. Viral sequence divergence during acute infection is predominantly fueled by single-base substitutions and is limited by treatment initiation during the earliest stages of disease. Our observations provide rare longitudinal insights of HIV-1 DNA sequence profiles during the first year of infection to inform future HIV cure research.\n",
      "Reliable and accurate laboratory assays to detect recent HIV-1 infection have potential as simple and practical methods of estimating HIV-1 incidence in cross-sectional surveys. This study describes validation of the limiting-antigen (LAg) avidity enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in a cross-sectional national survey, conducted in Swaziland, comparing it to prospective follow-up incidence. As part of the Swaziland HIV-1 Incidence Measurement Survey (SHIMS), 18,172 individuals underwent counseling and HIV rapid testing in a household-based, population survey conducted from December 2010 to June 2011. Plasma samples from HIV-positive persons were classified as recent infections using an incidence testing algorithm with LAg-Avidity EIA (normalized optical density ≤1.5) followed by viral load (VL ≥1,000 copies/mL). All HIV-seronegative samples were tested for acute HIV-1 infection by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) pooling. HIV-seronegative individuals who consented to follow-up were retested ∼6 months later to detect observed HIV-1 seroconversion. HIV-1 incidence estimates based on LAg+VL and NAAT were calculated using assay-specific parameters and were compared with prospective incidence estimate. A total of 5,803 (31.9%) of 18,172 survey participants tested HIV seropositive; of these 5,683 (97.9%) were further tested with LAg+VL algorithm. The weighted annualized incidence from the longitudinal cohort study was 2.4% (95% confidence interval 2.0-2.7). Based on cross-sectional testing of HIV positives with LAg+VL algorithm, overall weighted annualized HIV-1 incidence was 2.5% (2.0-3.0), whereas NAAT-based incidence was of 2.6%. In addition, LAg-based incidence in men (1.8%; 1.2-2.5) and women (3.2%; 2.4-3.9) were similar to estimates based on observed incidence (men = 1.7%, women = 3.1%). Changes in HIV-1 incidence with age in men and women further validate plausibility of the algorithm. These results demonstrate that the LAg EIA, in a serial algorithm with VL, is a cost-effective tool to estimate HIV-1 incidence in cross-sectional surveys.\n",
      "Primary HIV infection (PHI) is the initial phase after HIV acquisition characterized by high viral replication, massive inflammatory response and irreversible immune-damage, particularly at the gastrointestinal level. In this study we aimed to characterize the dynamics of gastrointestinal damage biomarkers during the different phases of HIV infection and assess their association with HIV-disease markers and their accuracy to differentiate PHI from chronic HIV infection (CHI).\n",
      "PHI-individuals (n = 57) were identified as HIV-seronegative/HIV-RNA positive and were followed up for one year at the Manhiça District Hospital in Mozambique. Ten plasma and 12 stool biomarkers were quantified by Luminex or ELISA and levels were compared to CHI-naive (n = 26), CHI on antiretroviral-treatment (ART; n = 30) and HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 58). Regression models adjusted by time point were used to estimate the association of the biomarkers with HIV-disease markers. Receiver operating curves were compared for the best accuracy to distinguish PHI from CHI.\n",
      "Soluble (s)CD14 was significantly associated with the CD4/CD8 ratio (P < 0.05) and viremia levels (P < 0.0001) during PHI. Plasma zonulin and stool lactoferrin were significantly higher in PHI as compared to CHI-individuals (P < 0.05). Plasma zonulin demonstrated the best accuracy to identify PHI among HIV-infected individuals (AUC = 0.85 [95% CI 0.75-0.94]). Using a cutoff value of plasma zonulin ≥ 8.75 ng/mL the model identified PHI with 87.7% sensitivity (95% CI 76.3-94.9) and 69.2% specificity (95% CI 48.2-85.7). An adjusted multivariate model including age, plasma zonulin and sCD14 further increased the classification performance (AUC = 0.92 [95% CI 0.86-0.99]).\n",
      "While the stool biomarkers did not provide any predictive ability to distinguish PHI from CHI-individuals, plasma sCD14 and zonulin were significantly associated with HIV-disease markers and PHI identification, respectively. These inflammatory biomarkers may be useful to monitor changes in gastrointestinal integrity during HIV infection.\n",
      "Detection of acute HIV infection is a unique problem that fourth-generation HIV assays were expected to alleviate. In this commentary, we draw attention to the limitations and challenges with use of currently available rapid antigen-antibody (Ag/Ab) combination tests for detection of acute HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Laboratory-based HIV-1 Ag/Ab immunoassays are complex, requiring specialized equipment and handling that are currently not affordable in many settings in Africa. The point-of-care Ag/Ab platform on the other hand is easier to deploy and potentially more accessible in resource-limited settings. However, available fourth-generation HIV-1 rapid diagnostic tests have demonstrated poor performance characteristics in field studies where non-B subtypes of HIV-1 dominate. The potential for point-of-care HIV-1 Ag/Ab diagnostics to significantly improve detection of acute HIV infection remains yet to be realized in sub-Saharan Africa. Assay platforms need to be optimized to identify local circulating subtypes, and optimal algorithms need to be determined.\n",
      "The risk of death from complications related to cancer of the cervix is a main health problem over the course of a woman's life in low income countries. It commonly affects women infected with HIV. Therefore, screening women infected with HIV should start in low income countries, including Ethiopia.\n",

      "This study points out the prevalence of pre-cancerous lesions of the cervix is high. Thus, the findings recommend raising of a screening strategy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia for all women living with HIV should be undertaken.

      "Targeted newborn testing requires access to maternal VL. Even if risk models include parameters such as maternal cART history, birth weight, weeks' gestation, and symptoms, 1 in 5 newborns who are infected will not be targeted.

      "In rhesus macaques, simian immunodeficiency virus infection is followed by expansion of enteric viruses but has a limited impact on the gut bacteriome. To understand the longitudinal effects of HIV-1 infection on the human gut microbiota, we prospectively followed 49 Mozambican subjects diagnosed with recent HIV-1 infection (RHI) and 54 HIV-1-negative controls for 9-18 months and compared them with 98 chronically HIV-1-infected subjects treated with antiretrovirals (n = 27) or not (n = 71).\n",
      "We show that RHI is followed by increased fecal adenovirus shedding, which persists during chronic HIV-1 infection and does not resolve with ART. Recent HIV-1 infection is also followed by transient non-HIV-specific changes in the gut bacterial richness and composition. Despite early resilience to change, an HIV-1-specific signature in the gut bacteriome-featuring depletion of Akkermansia, Anaerovibrio, Bifidobacterium, and Clostridium-previously associated with chronic inflammation, CD8+ T cell anergy, and metabolic disorders, can be eventually identified in chronically HIV-1-infected subjects.\n",
      "Recent HIV-1 infection is associated with increased fecal shedding of eukaryotic viruses, transient loss of bacterial taxonomic richness, and long-term reductions in microbial gene richness.

      "Chimeric Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (SHIVs) are an important tool for evaluating anti-HIV Env interventions in nonhuman primate (NHP) models. However, most unadapted SHIVs do not replicate well in vivo limiting their utility. Furthermore, adaptation in vivo often negatively impacts fundamental properties of the Env, including neutralization profiles. Transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses are particularly important to study since they represent viruses that initiated primary HIV-1 infections and may have unique attributes. Here we combined in vivo competition and rational design to develop novel subtype C SHIVs containing T/F envelopes. We successfully generated 19 new, infectious subtype C SHIVs, which were tested in multiple combinatorial pools in Indian-origin rhesus macaques. Infected animals attained peak viremia within 5 weeks ranging from 103 to 107 vRNA copies/mL. Sequence analysis during primary infection revealed 7 different SHIVs replicating in 8 productively infected animals with certain clones prominent in each animal. We then generated 5 variants each of 6 SHIV clones (3 that predominated and 3 undetectable after pooled in vivo inoculations), converting a serine at Env375 to methionine, tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan or phenylalanine. Overall, most Env375 mutants replicated better in vitro and in vivo than wild type with both higher and earlier peak viremia. In 4 of these SHIV clones (with and without Env375 mutations) we also created mutations at position 281 to include serine, alanine, valine, or threonine. Some Env281 mutations imparted in vitro replication dynamics similar to mutations at 375; however, clones with both mutations did not exhibit incremental benefit. Therefore, we identified unique subtype C T/F SHIVs that replicate in rhesus macaques with improved acute phase replication kinetics without altering phenotype. In vivo competition and rational design can produce functional SHIVs with globally relevant HIV-1 Envs to add to the growing number of SHIV clones for HIV-1 research in NHPs.\n",
      "Biomarkers for detecting early HIV infection and estimating HIV incidence should minimize false-recent rates (FRRs) while maximizing mean duration of recent infection (MDRI). We compared HIV subtypes B, E and D (BED) capture enzyme immunoassay (BED), Sedia limiting antigen (LAg) avidity enzyme immunoassay, and Bio-Rad avidity incidence (BRAI) assays using samples from Zimbabwean postpartum women infected with clade C HIV. We calculated MDRIs using 590 samples from 351 seroconverting postpartum women, and FRRs using samples from 2,825 women known to be HIV positive for >12 months. Antibody kinetics were more predictable with LAg and had higher precision compared with BED or BRAI. BRAI also exhibited more variability, and avidity reversal in some cases. For BED, LAg, and BRAI, used alone or with viral load, MDRI values in days were: BED-188 and 170 at normalized optical density (ODn) 0.8; LAg-104 and 100 at ODn cutoff 1.5; BRAI-135 and 134 at avidity index cutoff 30%. Corresponding FRRs were: BRAI 1.1% and 1.0% and LAg 0.57% and 0.35%: these were 3.8-10.9 times lower than BED values of 4.8% and 3.8%. BRAI and LAg have significantly lower FRRs and MDRIs than in published studies, and much lower than BED and could be used to estimate incidence in perinatal women and to measure population-level HIV incidence in HIV control operations in Africa.\n",

      "Of the 1,786 pregnant women who delivered in the selected clinics, HIV status at the time of delivery was known for 1,756 (98%) of whom 197 (11%) were HIV seropositive. Only 19 (10%) could be classified as \"high risk\" for MTCT and the remaining 90% lacked adequate information to classify them into high or low risk for MTCT due to missing data. Of the 197 live births, only two (1%) infants had a nucleic-acid test (NAT) at birth and 32 (16%) infants had NAT at 6 weeks. Of all 197 infants, 183 (93%) were initiated on single ARV prophylaxis (Nevirapine), 15 (7%) infants' ARV prophylaxis status was not documented and one infant got dual ARV prophylaxis (Nevirapine+Zidovudine).\n",
      "There was paucity of data requisite for MTCT risk stratification due to poor recording of data; \"high risk\" women were missed in the few circumstances where sufficient data were available. Thus \"high risk\" HEI are deprived of dual ARV prophylaxis and priority HIV NAT at birth and onwards which they require for PMTCT. Health workers need urgent training, mentorship and supportive supervision to master data management and perform MTCT risk stratification satisfactorily.\n",
      "The World Health Organization recommends using HIV self-testing (HIVST) to improve HIV testing coverage by integrating self-testing for HIV into public domain primary healthcare (PHC) clinics in areas with a high burden of HIV. However, an understanding of the relationship and interaction between HIVST and the standard HIV counselling and testing (HCT), the primary HIV testing approach within public PHC clinics, is limited. We therefore sought to compare experiences of people seeking an HIV test, specifically, how HIVST can be used to enhance HCT when introduced together. A cross-over study design was used wherein participants were randomly exposed to either HCT followed by HIVST or HIVST followed by HCT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the baseline, and after each testing exposure. Forty volunteers were enrolled and 119 interviews were completed. Although a higher preference for HIVST was reported, a symbiotic relationship between HIVST and HCT was identified, where benefits of one testing approach overcame barriers of the other. Introducing HIVST as an additional testing approach with HCT within PHC facilities in South Africa could positively influence HIV testing given their complementary relationship. HIVST and HCT should accommodate HIV testing situations among HIV testing naïve and repeat testing populations.\n",
      "The 'Primary HIV Prevention among Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women' (PRIMAL) study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an enhanced HIV counseling intervention for preventing HIV acquisition among HIV-uninfected mothers during pregnancy and throughout the breastfeeding period.\n",
      "We conducted an unblinded randomized control trial between 22 February 2013 and 22 April 2016 to assess the effectiveness of an extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling (ERHTEC) intervention aimed at preventing primary HIV infection among HIV-uninfected pregnant and lactating women in Uganda. HIV-uninfected pregnant women aged 15-49 were enrolled 1:1 individually or in couples together with their partner. Enrolled women and couples were randomized 1:1 to an intervention (ERHTEC) or control (extended repeat HIV testing and standard counseling) group and followed up to 24 months postpartum or six weeks past complete cessation of breastfeeding, whichever came first. Both groups were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV at enrollment, delivery, 3 and 6 months postpartum and every 6 months thereafter until the end of follow-up. The intervention group received enhanced HIV prevention counseling every 3 months throughout follow-up. The control group received standard counseling at the time of HIV retesting. Both intervention and control couples were offered couple HIV testing and counseling at all study visits.\n",
      "Frequency of condom use and incidence of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis over follow-up.\n",
      "Between February 2013 and April 2014, we enrolled 820 HIV-uninfected pregnant women presenting for antenatal care individually (n = 410) or in couples (n = 410 women and 410 partners) in one urban and one rural public Ugandan hospital. Women's median age was 24 years (IQR 20-28 years). At baseline, participants did not differ in any socio-demographic, reproductive health, HIV testing history, sexual behavior, medical history or STI status characteristics; 96% (386/402) of couples were tested and counseled for HIV together with their partners at enrolment, 2.1% (7/329) of whom were found to be HIV-infected. Six hundred twenty-five (76%) women completed follow-up as per protocol (S1 Protocol). Women were followed for an average of 1.76 years and cumulated 1,439 women-years of follow-up or 81% of the maximum 1,779 women-years of follow-up assuming no dropouts. Men were followed for an average of 1.72 years. The frequency of consistent condom use and the proportion of women who used condoms over the last 3 months or at last vaginal sex increased substantially over follow-up in both arms, but there were no statistically significant differences in increases between the intervention and control arms. During follow-up, on average 42% (range 36%-46%) of couple partners were counseled together. Between 3.8% and 7.6% of women tested positive at any follow-up visit for any STI including syphilis, gonorrhea, C. trachomatis or T. vaginalis. Four women (two in each arm) and no enrolled men became infected with HIV, representing an overall HIV incidence rate of 0.186 per 100 person-years. Three of the women seroconverters had enrolled individually, one as a couple. At or before seroconversion, all four women reported their partners had extramarital relationships and/or had not disclosed their suspected HIV-infected status. There were no statistically significant differences between study arms for STI or HIV incidences.\n",
      "A sustained enhanced HIV prevention counseling intervention for up to 2 years postpartum among pregnant and breastfeeding women did not have a statistically significant effect on condom use or HIV incidence among these women. However, in both study arms, condom use increased over follow-up while STI and HIV incidence remained very low when compared to similar cohorts in and outside Uganda, suggesting that repeat HIV testing during breastfeeding, whether with enhanced or standard counseling, may have had an unintended HIV preventive effect among pregnant and lactating women in this setting. Further research is needed to verify this hypothesis.\n",

      "High rates of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance was a key consideration in the WHO policies transitioning first-line regimens to include integrase inhibitors (dolutegravir [DTG]). However, recent data suggests a relationship between DTG and neural tube defects among women exposed during conception, giving providers and policymakers pause regarding the planned regimen changes. We examined HIV drug resistance among a cohort of 46 acutely infected persons in Malawi. Our data demonstrates high levels of transmitted resistance, 11% using standard resistance surveillance mutations and 20% when additional NNRTI polymorphisms that may affect treatment response are included. High resistance rates in this treatment-naïve patient population reinforces the critical nature of DTG-based options in the context of public-health driven treatment programs.\n",
      "Co-diagnosis of HIV and tuberculosis presents a treatment dilemma. Starting both treatments at the same time can cause a flood of immune response called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) which can be lethal. But, how long to delay HIV treatment is less understood. In 2011, based on the conclusions of three separate studies, WHO recommended starting HIV treatment earlier for those with later HIV disease progression. This paper conducts a replication study of one of the three studies, by Havlir and colleagues. Using their publicly available data, we were able to replicate most of the results presented in the original paper. In our measurement and estimation analyses we use different estimation techniques to assess the robustness of the results. We find that adjusting for loss to follow-up does not affect the main results of the paper. However, an ANCOVA estimation and an instrumental variable model weaken the main result of the paper of better outcomes with early HIV treatment only for those who are sicker, reducing significance from the 5% to the 10% level. A change-point analysis also detects no changes in effect by timing of HIV treatment initiation or different thresholds of CD4 count for the primary outcome. This result suggests that the choice of start time for HIV treatment initiation should be based on other factors including potential drug interactions, overlapping side effects, a high pill burden and severity of illness rather than CD4 threshold and preset timeframes. While we caution against overgeneralizing, the result of this replication is aligned with more recent studies that show no evidence that early initiation of HIV treatment reduces mortality for any patients.\n",
      "Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) have heightened transmission risk. We evaluated potential transmission reduction using behavioral and biomedical interventions in a randomized controlled pilot study in Malawi.\n",
      "Persons were randomized 1:2:2 to standard counseling (SC), 5-session behavioral intervention (BI), or behavioral intervention plus 12 weeks of antiretrovirals (ARVs; BIA). All were followed for 26-52 weeks and, regardless of arm, referred for treatment according to Malawi-ARV guidelines. Participants were asked to refer partners for testing.\n",
      "Among 46 persons (9 SC, 18 BI, 19 BIA), the average age was 28; 61% were male. The median viral load (VL) was 5.9 log copies/mL at enrollment. 67% (10/15) of BIA participants were suppressed (<1000 copies/mL) at week 12 vs 25% BI and 50% SC (\n",
      "Diagnosis of AHI facilitates behavioral and biomedical risk reduction strategies during a high-transmission period that begins years before people are typically identified and started on ARVs. Sexually transmitted infection incidence in this cohort suggests ongoing risk behaviors, reinforcing the importance of early intervention with ARVs to reduce transmission. Early diagnosis coupled with standard AHI counseling and early ARV referral quickly suppresses viremia, may effectively change behavior, and could have tremendous public health benefit in reducing onward transmission.\n",
      "We aimed to establish the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated malignancies in children attending a care and treatment clinic at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre.\n",
      "This was a retrospective cross-sectional hospital-based study of children who attended an HIV care and treatment clinic between 2006 and 2014. Children 2 months to 17 years of age were eligible for participation. The data on social demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the medical record. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to determine predictors of HIV-associated malignancies.\n",
      "Medical records from 721 HIV-infected children were reviewed. The median age (interquartile range) at HIV diagnosis was 5.7 (2.0 to 9.4) years. Among them, 34 (4.7%) had HIV-associated malignancies. The most common (n=24, 70.3%) malignancy was the Kaposi sarcoma. Age at HIV diagnosis was significantly associated with HIV-associated malignancies (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.3). Among 34 patients with HIV-associated malignancies, 11 (32.4%) died. Seven (20.6%) patients reported complete remission from their malignancies, and outcomes for 6 patients were unknown.\n",
      "The prevalence of HIV-associated malignancies was high and was associated with late HIV diagnosis. The Kaposi sarcoma was the commonest malignancy. Early HIV diagnosis and treatment in children might reduce HIV-associated malignancies.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to analyse the association of baseline biomarker data with cross-sectional lung function and subsequent decline in lung function in HIV-positive persons.\n",
      "Lung function was modelled in all START pulmonary substudy participants who had baseline biomarker data and good-quality spirometry. In longitudinal analyses, we restricted to those participants with at least one good-quality follow-up spirometry test.\n",
      "We performed linear regression of baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC and their longitudinal slopes on log2-transformed baseline biomarkers with adjustment for age, sex, race, region, smoking status, baseline CD4+ T-cell counts and baseline HIV-RNA. Biomarkers included D-dimer, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-27, serum amyloid A, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1, albumin and total bilirubin.\n",
      "Among 903 included participants, baseline median age was 36 years, CD4+ cell count was 647 cells/μl, and 28.5% were current smokers. In adjusted analyses, elevated markers of systemic inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6 and serum amyloid A) were associated with lower baseline FEV1 and FVC. Elevated D-dimer and IL-6 were associated with worse airflow obstruction (lower FEV1/FVC). Despite these cross-sectional associations at baseline, no associations were found between baseline biomarkers and subsequent longitudinal lung function decline over a median follow-up time of 3.9 years (3293 spirometry-years of follow-up).\n",
      "Commonly available biomarkers, in particular markers of systemic inflammation, are associated with worse cross-sectional lung function, but do not associate with subsequent lung function decline among HIV-positive persons with early HIV infection and baseline CD4 T-cell counts more than 500 cells/μl.\n",
      "Understanding sexual networks involving acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infections (AHI) may lead to prevention opportunities to mitigate high rates of onward transmission. We evaluated HIV-1 phylogenetic and behavioral characteristics among persons with AHI and their referred partners.\n",
      "Between 2012 and 2014, 46 persons with AHI in Malawi participated in a combined behavioral and biomedical intervention. Participants referred sexual partners by passive referral. Demographics and sexual behaviors were collected through interviews and HIV-1 genetic relationships were assessed with phylogenetics.\n",
      "Among 45 AHI participants with HIV-1 sequences, none was phylogenetically-linked with another AHI index. There were 19 (42%) AHI participants who referred a single partner that returned for testing. Most partners (n = 17) were HIV-infected, with 15 (88%) presenting with an established infection. There were 14 index-partner pairs that had sequences available; 13 (93%) pairs were phylogenetically-linked dyads. The AHI index was female in 7/13 (54%) dyads. Age-disparate relationships among dyads were common (≥5-year age difference in 67% of dyads), including 3/6 dyads involving a male index and a younger woman. Index participants with a referred partner were more likely to report no casual partners and to be living with their current partner than participants not in dyads.\n",
      "Passive-partner referral successfully identified partners with genetically-similar HIV infections-the likely source of infection-but only 40% of index cases referred partners who presented for HIV-1 testing. Future work evaluating assisted partner notification may help reach susceptible partners or more people with untreated HIV-1 infections connected to acute transmission.\n",

      "Diagnosing and treating patients with acute or early HIV-1 infection (AEHI) is an important strategy to prevent HIV-1 transmission. We used qualitative methods to understand factors that facilitate adjustment to AEHI diagnosis, prompt linkage to care and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Twenty-three AEHI patients (12 women, 11 men) included 18 participants identified at health facilities, and 5 participants identified in a sex worker cohort. Of these, 17 participants (9 women, 8 men) participated in qualitative interviews about their AEHI status 2 weeks after diagnosis. Thirteen participants (7 women, 6 men) returned for a second interview 12 weeks after diagnosis. Interviews explored participants' experiences at the time of and following their diagnosis, and examined perceptions about ART initiation and behavior change recommendations, including disclosure and partner notification. A grounded theory framework was used for analysis, eliciting three important needs that should be addressed for AEHI patients: 1) the need to better understand AEHI and accept one's status; 2) the need to develop healthy strategies and adjust to the reality of AEHI status; and 3) the need to protect self and others through ART initiation, adherence, safer sex, and disclosure. A preliminary conceptual framework to guide further intervention and research with AEHI populations is proposed.\n",
      "HIV-exposed infants (HEI) lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) remains a problem in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). In 2015, SSA accounted >90% of the 150,000 new infant HIV infections, with an estimated 13,000 reported in Kenya. Despite proven and effective HIV interventions, many HEI fail to benefit because of LTFU. LTFU leads to delays or no initiation of interventions, thereby contributing to significant child morbidity and mortality. Kenya did not achieve the <5% mother-to-child HIV transmission target by 2015 because of problems such as LTFU. We sought to investigate factors associated with LTFU of HEI in Kericho County, Kenya.\n",
      "A case-control study was conducted in June 2016 employing 1:2 frequency matching by age and hospital of birth. We recruited HEI from HEI birth cohort registers from hospitals for the months of September 2014 through February 2016. Cases were infant-mother pairs that missed their 3-month clinic appointments while controls were those that adhered to their 3-month follow-up visits. Consent was obtained from caregivers and a structured questionnaire was administered. We used chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests to compare groups, calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and performed logistic regression to identify independent risk factors.\n",
      "We enrolled 44 cases and 88 controls aged ≥3 to 18 months: Cases ranged from 7.3-17.8 months old and controls from 6.8-17.2 months old. LTFU cases' caregivers were more likely than controls' caregivers to fear knowing HEI status (aOR= 12.71 [CI 3.21-50.23]), lack knowledge that HEI are followed for 18 months (aOR= 12.01 [CI 2.92-48.83]), avoid partners knowing their HEI status(OR= 11.32 [CI 2.92-44.04]), and use traditional medicine (aOR= 6.42 [CI 1.81-22.91]).Factors that were protective of LTFU included mothers knowing their pre-pregnancy HIV status (aOR= 0.23 [CI 0.05-0.71]) and having household health insurance (aOR= 0.11 [CI 0.01-0.76]).\n",
      "Caregivers' intrinsic, interpersonal, community and health system factors remain crucial towards reducing HEI LTFU. Early HIV testing among mothers, disclosure support, health education, and partner involvement is advocated. Encouraging households to enroll in health insurance could be beneficial. Further studies on the magnitude and the reasons for use of home treatments among caregiver are recommended.\n",
      "Acute HIV infection (AHI) is the phase of HIV infection immediately after acquisition, during which many patients develop symptoms and often seek healthcare. However, clinicians in sub-Saharan Africa are not currently taught about AHI.\n",
      "This study pilot-tested a self-directed AHI training module among clinical officers (COs) in coastal Kenya and assessed knowledge gained and challenges to instituting screening. The training module included four domains: AHI definition and importance of AHI recognition; symptoms and screening algorithms; diagnostic strategies; and management. AHI knowledge was assessed before and immediately after training. Participants' ability to utilize an AHI screening algorithm was evaluated with a case-based exercise.\n",
      "Self-directed training was completed by 45 COs. Pre-test scores were low (median score 35% IQR 30-45%), but improved significantly after training (median post-test score 75%, IQR 70-85%, Wilcoxon signed-rank test p<0.0001). Participants had challenges in understanding the utility and application of a screening algorithm to identify patients for whom AHI testing would be indicated. Knowledge of AHI was poor at baseline, but improved with self-directed learning. Based on these findings, we revised and improved the AHI training module and pre- and post-assessments, which are now freely available online at www.marps-africa.org.\n",

      "In this brief review and perspective, we address the question of whether the immune responses that bring about immune control of acute HIV infection are the same as, or distinct from, those that maintain long-term viral suppression once control of viremia has been achieved. To this end, we describe the natural history of elite and post-treatment control, noting the lack of data regarding what happens acutely. We review the evidence suggesting that the two clinical phenotypes may differ in terms of the mechanisms required to achieve and maintain control, as well as the level of inflammation that persists once a steady state is achieved. We then describe the evidence from longitudinal studies of controllers who fail and studies of biologic sex (male versus female), age (children versus adults), and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (pathogenic/experimental versus nonpathogenic/natural infection). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the battle between the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways during acute infection has long-term consequences, both for the degree to which control is maintained and the health of the individual. Potent and stringent control of HIV may be required acutely, but once control is established, the chronic inflammatory response can be detrimental. Interventional approaches designed to bring about HIV cure and/or remission should be nuanced accordingly.\n",
      "Heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a significant bottleneck in the viral quasispecies population, yet the timing of that bottleneck is poorly understood. We characterized HIV-1 diversity in the blood and female genital tract (FGT) within 2 weeks after detection of infection in three women enrolled in a unique prospective cohort in South Africa. We assembled full-length HIV-1 genomes from matched cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples and plasma. Deep sequencing allowed us to identify intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) and to characterize within-sample HIV-1 diversity. Our results demonstrated very little HIV-1 diversity in the FGT and plasma by the time viremia was detectable. Within each subject, the consensus HIV-1 sequences were identical in plasma and CVL fluid. No iSNV was present at >6% frequency. One subject had 77 low-frequency iSNVs across both CVL fluid and plasma, another subject had 14 iSNVs in only CVL fluid from the earliest time point, and the third subject had no iSNVs in CVL fluid or plasma. Overall, the small amount of diversity that we detected was greater in the FGT than in plasma and declined over the first 2 weeks after viremia was detectable, compatible with a very early HIV-1 transmission bottleneck. To our knowledge, our study represents the earliest genomic analysis of HIV-1 in the FGT after transmission. Further, the use of metagenomic sequencing allowed us to characterize other organisms in the FGT, including commensal bacteria and sexually transmitted infections, highlighting the utility of the method to sequence both HIV-1 and its metagenomic environment.\n",

      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health problem. Early diagnosis, rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and monitoring of viral load are the key strategies for effective HIV management. Many people in resource limited settings where timely access to medical care is a challenge and healthcare infrastructure is poor have no access to laboratory facilities and diagnosis is dependent on the presence of point of care (POC) devices. POC instruments have shown to be easy to operate, maintain and transport and can easily be operated by less skilled health workers. Additionally, POC tests do not require laboratory technicians to operate. POC devices have resulted in a growing number of people testing for HIV and thereby receiving treatment early. In recent years, there has been great improvement in the development of POC technologies for early HIV diagnosis, HIV viral load and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) measurement. This review discusses POC technologies that are currently available and in the pipeline for diagnosing and monitoring HIV. We also give an overview of the technical and commercialization challenges in POC diagnostics for HIV.\n",

All were female and infected with non-B HIV subtypes, mainly C. We measured HIV DNA in CD4+ T cells, CD4+ cell count, plasma viral load (pVL), cell-associated HIV RNA and T-cell activation and exhaustion. We explored associations with clinical progression and time to pVL rebound after treatment interruption (n = 22). Data were compared with non-African Short Pulse Antiretroviral Treatment at HIV-1 Seroconversion participants.\n",
      "Pretherapy pVL and integrated HIV DNA were lower in Africans compared with non-Africans (median 4.16 vs. 4.72 log10 copies/ml and 3.07 vs. 3.61 log10 copies/million CD4+ T cells, respectively; P < 0.001). Pre-ART HIV DNA in Africans was associated with clinical progression (P = 0.001, HR per log10 copies/million CD4+ T cells increase (95% CI) 5.38 (1.95-14.79)) and time to pVL rebound (P = 0.034, HR per log10 copies/ml increase 4.33 (1.12-16.84)). After treatment interruption, Africans experienced longer duration of viral remission than non-Africans (P < 0.001; HR 3.90 (1.75-8.71). Five of 22 African participants (22.7%) maintained VL less than 400 copies/ml over a median of 188 weeks following treatment interruption.\n",

      "The objective of the study was to establish the mother-baby pair characteristics that contribute to vertical transmission of HIV and elucidate on remediation. We assessed for factors increasing the odds of HIV transmission in children born to HIV-infected mothers in western Kenya. We used a retrospective study which reviewed routinely collected data of 1 028 mother-baby pairs enrolled in a prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme in western Kenya from January to December 2015. We compared the transmission rates amongst mothers known to have a positive HIV status before conception (known positives/KPs) versus the transmission amongst those who were newly diagnosed during maternal and child health (MCH) clinic attendance (new positives/NPs). We compared the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the mothers using chi square and Kruskal-Wallis tests at 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed for factors associated with the infants' HIV status using a logistic regression model. The results revealed that 60% (622) of the mothers were KPs, and that KPs and NPs had mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rates of 5.5% and 20.7% respectively. Close to 90% of the NP Mothers were at an early HIV clinical stage at enrolment and 40% were enrolled after delivery. The infants of NPs were enrolled at a mean age of 18.3 weeks compared to 6.6 weeks for the infants of the KPs. On adjusted multivariable analysis, child's age at enrolment (AOR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.036-1.064) and mother's status at conception (AOR = 1.96, 95%CI = 1.042-3.664) were significantly associated with the infant's HIV status. None of the HIV infected infants had received nevirapine prophylaxis. Most of the mothers enrolling into the PMTCT programme have a known HIV-positive status, however, NPs are the largest contributors to continued MTCT.\n",

HIV-1 RNA loads (Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay) were tested in the blood before and at months 3, 6 and 12 after initiation of ART. Primary and acquired resistances to ART were evaluated by the Viroseq™ HIV-1 genotyping assay.\n",
      "During the study, 8.4% of people died and 37% were lost to follow-up. After 1 year of ART, an undetectable HIV-1 RNA viral load was found in 87.7% of cases. The overall rate of primary drug resistance mutations was 17.5% (3.2%, 15.9% and 0% for NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, respectively). These mutations were not associated with either higher mortality rates or larger numbers of virological failures. The acquired resistance rate was estimated at 3.1%.\n",
      "Our study showed a high primary resistance level and a huge proportion of people non-adherent to the treatment programme.

      "In 1998 we estimated that 34/million infectious window period donations were entering the blood supply at the South African National Blood Service. Selective use of donations based on donor race-ethnicity reduced this risk to 26/million donations but was deemed unethical. Consequently, in 2005 South African National Blood Service eliminated race-ethnicity-based collection policies and implemented individual-donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT). We describe the change in donor base demographics, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection rates, and transfusion-transmissible HIV risk.\n",
      "In ten years 7.7 million donations were tested for anti-HIV and HIV RNA. Number of donations, HIV prevalence, ID-NAT yield rate, serology yield rate and residual transfusion-transmissible HIV risk were analyzed by donor type, race-ethnicity, age, and sex. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the determinants of HIV-positive and nucleic acid testing yield donations.\n",
      "The combined strategy of increasing donations from black donors and implementing ID-NAT increased the proportion of donations from black donors from 6% in 2005 to 30% in 2015 (p < 0.00001), and reduced the transfusion-transmissible risk from 24 to 13 per million transfusions. ID-NAT interdicted 481 (1:16,100) seronegative window period donations, while one transfusion-transmissible case (0.13 per million) was documented. Race-ethnicity and donor type were highly significant predictors of HIV positivity, with adjusted odds ratio for first-time donors of 12.5 (95% confidence interval, 11.9-13.1) and for black race-ethnicity of 31.1 (95% confidence interval, 28.9-33.4).

      "HIV-1 can downregulate HLA-C on infected cells, using the viral protein Vpu, and the magnitude of this downregulation varies widely between primary HIV-1 variants. The selection pressures that result in viral downregulation of HLA-C in some individuals, but preservation of surface HLA-C in others are not clear. To better understand viral immune evasion targeting HLA-C, we have characterized HLA-C downregulation by a range of primary HIV-1 viruses. 128 replication competent viral isolates from 19 individuals with effective anti-retroviral therapy, show that a substantial minority of individuals harbor latent reservoir virus which strongly downregulates HLA-C. Untreated infections display no change in HLA-C downregulation during the first 6 months of infection, but variation between viral quasispecies can be detected in chronic infection. Vpu molecules cloned from plasma of 195 treatment naïve individuals in chronic infection demonstrate that downregulation of HLA-C adapts to host HLA genotype. HLA-C alleles differ in the pressure they exert for downregulation, and individuals with higher levels of HLA-C expression favor greater viral downregulation of HLA-C. Studies of primary and mutant molecules identify 5 residues in the transmembrane region of Vpu, and 4 residues in the transmembrane domain of HLA-C, which determine interactions between Vpu and HLA. The observed adaptation of Vpu-mediated downregulation to host genotype indicates that HLA-C alleles differ in likelihood of mediating a CTL response that is subverted by viral downregulation, and that preservation of HLA-C expression is favored in the absence of these responses. Finding that latent reservoir viruses can downregulate HLA-C could have implications for HIV-1 cure therapy approaches in some individuals.\n",
      "The GI tract is preferentially targeted during acute/early HIV-1 infection. Consequent damage to the gut plays a central role in HIV pathogenesis. The basis for preferential targeting of gut tissues is not well defined. Recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides derived from HIV and SIV gp120 bind directly to integrin α4β7, a gut-homing receptor. Using both cell-surface expressed α4β7 and a soluble α4β7 heterodimer we demonstrate that its specific affinity for gp120 is similar to its affinity for MAdCAM (its natural ligand). The gp120 V2 domain preferentially engages extended forms of α4β7 in a cation -sensitive manner and is inhibited by soluble MAdCAM. Thus, V2 mimics MAdCAM in the way that it binds to α4β7, providing HIV a potential mechanism to discriminate between functionally distinct subsets of lymphocytes, including those with gut-homing potential. Furthermore, α4β7 antagonists developed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, block V2 binding to α4β7. A 15-amino acid V2 -derived peptide is sufficient to mediate binding to α4β7. It includes the canonical LDV/I α4β7 binding site, a cryptic epitope that lies 7-9 amino acids amino terminal to the LDV/I, and residues K169 and I181. These two residues were identified in a sieve analysis of the RV144 vaccine trial as sites of vaccine -mediated immune pressure. HIV and SIV V2 mAbs elicited by both vaccination and infection that recognize this peptide block V2-α4β7 interactions. These mAbs recognize conformations absent from the β- barrel presented in a stabilized HIV SOSIP gp120/41 trimer. The mimicry of MAdCAM-α4β7 interactions by V2 may influence early events in HIV infection, particularly the rapid seeding of gut tissues, and supports the view that HIV replication in gut tissue is a central feature of HIV pathogenesis.\n",
      "Diagnosis of acute HIV infection (AHI) presents an opportunity to prevent HIV transmission during a highly infectious period. Disclosure is important during AHI as a means to facilitate safer sex practices and notify partners, particularly as those with AHI may be better able to identify the source of their infection because of the recency of HIV acquisition. However, little is known about disclosure during AHI. We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with Malawians diagnosed with AHI (24 men; 21 married). Most participants reported disclosing to a sexual partner within a month of diagnosis, and knew or had a strong suspicion about the source of their infection. Participants often assumed their source had knowingly infected them, contributing to anger and feeling that disclosure is futile if the source already knew their HIV status. Assisted partner notification, individual and couples counseling, and couples HIV testing may facilitate disclosure during AHI.\n",

      "For more than three decades, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continue to dominate the health agenda. In sub-Saharan African countries, women are at more risk of contracting HIV and AIDS compared with men due to biological, social, economic, socio-economic and cultural factors. Women in the uniformed services may be more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS because of their work context, mobility, age and other factors that expose them to a higher risk of infection than women in the general population. This article describes gender dimensions, motives and challenges towards HIV prevention amongst Police officers (POs) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n",
      "This was a descriptive qualitative study conducted at Police stations in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted on POs; seven men, and eight women. Content analysis approach was used to analyze data.\n",
      "Participants' self-descriptions shed light on gender differences in relation to self -perceptions, job contexts, sexual relationships and HIV prevention. Both men and women perceived themselves as role models, and believed that the surrounding community perceived the same. Safe sexual behavior appeared crucial to avoid undesirable health outcomes. Risky sexual practices were considered avoidable. Under unavoidable sexual temptations, women in particular would be keen to avoid risky sexual practices. Some participants expressed positive views towards condoms use during extra-marital sexual relationships, while others had negative opinions. Early phases of HIV vaccine trials appeared to gain support from sexual partners. However, condom use during phase I/II HIV vaccine trials was deemed as difficult. Support from the spouse was reported to influence condom use outside the wedlock. However, religious beliefs, socio-cultural issues and individual reasons were perceived as difficulties to promote condoms use.\n",
      "These findings increase understanding of gender differences and context specific efforts towards HIV prevention. Individuals' assertiveness against risky sexual practices and the intention to participate in HIV vaccine trials to develop an effective vaccine are worth noting. Nevertheless, uncertainties towards condoms use underscore the importance of condoms' marketing particularly in extra marital sexual relationships and during early HIV vaccine trials.\n",
      "Despite dramatic global progress with implementing prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs, there were 160,000 new pediatric HIV infections in 2016. More than 50% of infant HIV infections now occur in the postpartum period, reflecting the relatively high coverage of interventions in the antenatal period and the need for greater attention to the breastfeeding mother and her HIV-exposed infant (HEI). Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children; however, early infant HIV testing rates remain low in most high HIV-burden countries. Furthermore, systematic retention and follow-up of HEI in the postpartum period and ascertainment of final HIV status remain major program gaps. Despite multiple calls to action to improve infant HIV testing rates, progress has been marginal due to a lack of focus on the critical health care needs of HEI coupled with health system barriers that result in fragmented services for HIV-infected mothers and their families. In this paper, we describe the available evidence on the health outcomes of HEI, define a comprehensive care package for HEI that extends beyond early HIV testing, and describe successful examples of integrated services for HEI.\n",
      "In countries with low tuberculosis (TB) incidence, TB is concentrated in vulnerable populations, including people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), who have a substantially greater risk of TB than people without HIV. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies evaluating the risk factors for latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) or active TB in PLHIV in countries with TB incidence 10 per 100 000 population. Due to the number of risk factors evaluated and heterogeneity in study designs, we present summary data and a narrative synthesis. We included 45 studies: 17 reported data on the risk factors for LTBI and 32 on active TB. Black, Asian or Hispanic ethnicity, birth or long-term residence in a country with high TB incidence, and HIV acquisition via injecting drug use (IDU) or heterosexual sex were strong predictors of both LTBI and active TB. History of contact, a greater degree of immunosuppression at diagnosis or higher viral load increased the TB risk. Early HIV diagnosis to allow timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy is essential for the prevention of TB in PLHIV. Screening and treating PLHIV for LTBI to reduce the risk of progression to active TB disease should also be considered to further reduce the burden of active TB in low TB incidence settings. Research to support the expansion of TB and HIV prevention and treatment globally is essential to eliminate TB in low-incidence settings.\n",
      "Several studies reported that the majority of deaths in HIV-infected people are documented in their early antiretroviral therapy (ART) follow-ups. Early mortality refers to death of people on ART for follow up period of below 24 months due to any cause. The current study assessed predictors of early HIV mortality in Southwest Ethiopia.\n",
      "We have conducted a retrospective analysis of 5299 patient records dating from June 2003- March 2015. To estimate survival time and compare the time to event among the different groups of patients, we used a Kaplan Meir curve and log-rank test. To identify mortality predictors, we used a cox regression analysis. We used SPSS-20 for all analyses.\n",
      "A total of 326 patients died in the 12 years follow-up period contributing to 6.2% cumulative incidence and 21.7 deaths per 1000 person-year observations incidence rate. Eighty-nine percent of the total deaths were documented in the first two years follow up-an early-term ART follow up. Early HIV mortality rates among adults were 50% less in separated, divorced or widowed patients compared with never married patients, 1.6 times higher in patients with baseline CD4 count <200 cells/μL compared to baseline CD4 count ≥200 cells/μL, 1.5 times higher in patients with baseline WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 compared to baseline WHO clinical stage 1 or 2, 2.1 times higher in patients with immunologic failure compared with no immunologic failure, 60% less in patients with fair or poor compared with good adherence, 2.9 times higher in patients with bedridden functional status compared to working functional status, and 2.7 times higher with patients who had no history of HIV testing before diagnosis compared to those who had history of HIV testing. Most predictors of early mortality remained the same to the predictors of an overall HIV mortality. When discontinuation was assumed as an event, the predictors of an overall HIV mortality included age between 25-50 years, base line CD4 count, developing immunologic failure, bedridden functional status, and no history of HIV testing before diagnosis.\n",
      "The great majority of deaths were documented in the first two years of ART, and several predictors of early HIV mortality were also for the overall mortality when discontinuation was assumed as event or censored.

      "The first set of outcomes consisted of five selected methods: (1) stakeholder consultations; (2) site assessments and selection; (3) field observations and mapping; (4) development of supportive structures to encourage retention and intervention adherence; (5) FGDs conducted with FSWs to explore specifics of acceptability. In terms of feasibility, two sites were selected in central Johannesburg and Pretoria out of five considered. The urban site contexts varied, necessitating adjustments to intervention implementation. There was overall support for PrEP and early ART from stakeholders and FSWs. Concerns included potential issues with adherence to PrEP (and early ART), possible reduction in condom use, resistance to antiretrovirals and burden on scarce resources. These concerns indicated where special attention should be focused on education, messaging and programming as well as development of supportive structures.\n",
      "The inductive approach allowed for a wide range of perspectives, defining population needs and accessibility. This research illustrated how similar sex work environments can vary and how implementation of interventions may not be uniform across contexts. Lessons learnt in details could assist in future project designs and implementation of new interventions where feasibility, social and cultural factors affecting acceptability must be considered.\n",

      "At our centre, 47% of patients presented at least one MO. While our LP rate was higher than the national figure of 49.8%, LPs were less likely to experience MOs, suggesting that these patients were diagnosed late through presenting late, rather than through being failed by our hospital. We conclude that, in addition to optimising provider-initiated testing, access to testing must be improved among patients who are unaware that they are at HIV risk and who do not seek healthcare.\n",

In the RV144 vaccine trial, nonneutralizing antibody responses were identified as a correlate for prevention of HIV acquisition. However, factors that predict the development of such antibodies are not fully elucidated. We sought to define the contribution of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) subsets to the development of nonneutralizing antibodies in HIV-1 clade C infection. Study participants were recruited from an acute HIV-1 clade C infection cohort. Plasma anti-gp41, -gp120, -p24, and -p17 antibodies were screened using a customized multivariate Luminex assay. Phenotypic and functional characterizations of cTfh cells were performed using HLA class II tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining. In this study, we found that acute HIV-1 clade C infection skewed the differentiation of functional cTfh subsets toward increased Tfh1 (\n",

EHV was defined as mean untreated viral load ≥5 log10 copies/ml 130-330 days post-EDI. We used logistic regression to develop risk score algorithms for predicting EHV based on sex, age, number of ARS symptoms, and CD4 and viral load at diagnosis.\n",
      "Models based on the full set of five predictors had excellent performance both in the full population (c-statistic = 0.80) and when confined to persons with each of three HIV-1 subtypes (c-statistic = 0.80-0.83 within subtypes A, C, and D). Reduced models containing only 2-4 predictors performed similarly. In a risk score algorithm based on the final full-population model, predictor scores were one for male sex and enrollment CD4<350 cells/mm3, and two for having enrollment viral load >4.9 log10 copies/ml. With a risk score cut-point of two, this algorithm was 85% sensitive (95% CI: 76%-91%) and 61% specific (55%-68%) in predicting EHV.\n",
      "Simple risk score algorithms can reliably identify persons with EHI in sub-Saharan Africa who are likely to sustain high viral loads if treatment is delayed.

In 2016, we estimated that of 654 868 patients entering care, 32.9% had advanced HIV disease, and 16.8% had very advanced HIV disease. Men were almost twice as likely as women (23.1% vs 12.6% ) to enter care with very advanced HIV disease.\n",

We evaluated 23,400 MAAs with different assays and assay cutoffs. We identified the MAA with the largest mean window period, where the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) of the shadow was <1 year. This MAA was compared to the LAg-Avidity and BioRad-Avidity assays alone, a widely used LAg algorithm (LAg-Avidity <1.5 OD-n + VL >1000 copies/mL), and two MAAs previously optimized for subtype B settings. We compared these cross-sectional incidence estimates to observed incidence in an independent longitudinal cohort.\n",
      "The optimal MAA was LAg-Avidity <2.8 OD-n  +  BioRad-Avidity <95% + VL >400 copies/mL. This MAA had a mean window period of 248 days (95% CI: 218, 284), a shadow of 306 days (95% CI: 255, 359), and provided the most accurate and precise incidence estimate for the independent cohort. The widely used LAg algorithm had a shorter mean window period (142 days, 95% CI: 118, 167), a longer shadow (410 days, 95% CI; 318, 491), and a less accurate and precise incidence estimate for the independent cohort.\n",

      "Demographic and HIV risk behaviour data were collected on a questionnaire from participants of a cross-sectional study that screened for early HIV infection using pooled nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). The study enrolled individuals who tested negative on rapid HIV tests performed at five HIV counseling and testing (HCT) clinics, which included four antenatal clinics and one general HCT clinic.\n",
      "The study enrolled 9547 predominantly black participants (96.6%) with a median age of 27 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-31). There were 1661 non-pregnant and 7886 pregnant participants largely enrolled from the general and antenatal HCT clinics, respectively. NAAT detected HIV infection in 61 participants (0.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-0.8) in the whole study. A high proportion of study participants, 62.8% and 63.0%, were unaware of their partner's HIV status; and also had high prevalence, 88.5% and 99.5%, of recent unprotected sex in the general and pregnant population, respectively. Consistent use of condoms was associated with protection against HIV infection in the general population. Trends of higher odds for HIV infection were observed with most demographic and HIV risk factors at univariate analysis, however, multivariate analysis did not show statistical significance for almost all these factors. A significantly lower risk of HIV infection was observed in circumcised men (p <0.001).\n",
      "These data show that a large segment of sexually active people in the Tshwane district of SA have high risk exposure to HIV. The detection of newly diagnosed HIV infections in all study clinics reflects a wide distribution of individuals who are capable of sustaining HIV transmission in the setting where HIV risk behaviour is highly prevalent. A questionnaire that captures HIV risk behaviour would be useful during HIV counselling and testing to ensure that there is a systematic way of identifying HIV risk factors and that counselling is optimised for each individual. HIV risk behaviour surveillance could be used to inform relevant HIV prevention interventions that could be implemented at a community or population level.\n",

Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, HIV-positive, had their own mobile phone or access to one, and were able to use simple text messaging (or have somebody who could text message on their behalf). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), with random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received a weekly text message from the automated WelTel service for 1 year and were asked to respond within 48 h. Participants in the control group did not receive text messages. Participants in both groups received usual care, which comprised psychosocial support and counselling; patient education; CD4 cell count; treatment; screening for tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, and sexually transmitted infections; prevention of mother-to-child transmission and family planning services; and up to two telephone calls for missed appointments. The primary outcome was retention in care at 12 months (ie, clinic attendance 10-14 months after the first visit). Participants who did not attend this 12-month appointment were traced, and we considered as retained those who were confirmed to be active in care elsewhere. The data analyst and clinic staff were masked to the group assignment, whereas participants and research nurses were not. We analysed the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01630304.\n",
      "Between April 4, 2013, and June 4, 2015, we screened 1068 individuals, of whom 700 were recruited. 349 people were allocated to the intervention group and 351 to the control group. Participants were followed up for a median of 55 weeks (IQR 51-60). At 12 months, 277 (79%) of 349 participants in the intervention group were retained, compared with 285 (81%) of 351 participants in the control group (risk ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·91-1·05; p=0·54). There was one mild adverse event related to the intervention, a domestic dispute that occurred when a participant's partner became suspicious of the weekly messages and follow-up calls.\n",

      "In 2014, city leaders from around the world endorsed the Paris Declaration on Fast-Track Cities, pledging to achieve the 2020 and 2030 HIV targets championed by UNAIDS. The City of Johannesburg - one of South Africa's metropolitan municipalities and also a health district - has over 600,000 people living with HIV (PLHIV), more than any other city worldwide. We estimate what it would take in terms of programmatic targets and costs for the City of Johannesburg to meet the Fast-Track targets, and demonstrate the impact that this would have.\n",
      "We applied the Optima HIV epidemic and resource allocation model to demographic, epidemiological and behavioural data on 26 sub-populations in Johannesburg. We used data on programme costs and coverage to produce baseline projections. We calculated how many people must be diagnosed, put onto treatment and maintained with viral suppression to achieve the 2020 and 2030 targets. We also estimated how treatment needs - and therefore fiscal commitments - could be reduced if the treatment targets are combined with primary HIV prevention interventions (voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), an expanded condom programme, and comprehensive packages for female sex workers (FSW) and young females).\n",
      "If current programmatic coverage were maintained, Johannesburg could expect 303,000 new infections and 96,000 AIDS-related deaths between 2017 and 2030 and 769,000 PLHIV by 2030. Achieving the Fast-Track targets would require an additional 135,000 diagnoses and 232,000 people on treatment by 2020 (an increase in around 80% over 2016 treatment numbers), but would avert 176,000 infections and 56,500 deaths by 2030. Assuming stable ART unit costs, this would require ZAR 29 billion (USD 2.15 billion) in cumulative treatment investments over the 14 years to 2030. Plausible scale-ups of other proven interventions (VMMC, condom distribution and FSW strategies) could yield additional reductions in new infections (between 4 and 15%), and in overall treatment investment needs. Scaling up VMMC in line with national targets is found to be cost-effective in the medium term.\n",
      "The scale-up in testing and treatment programmes over this decade has been rapid, but these efforts must be doubled to reach 2020 targets. Strategic investments in proven interventions will help Johannesburg achieve the treatment targets and be on track to end AIDS by 2030.\n",

      "In the majority of cases, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is transmitted through sexual intercourse. A single founder virus in the blood of the newly infected donor emerges from a genetic bottleneck, while in rarer instances multiple viruses are responsible for systemic infection. We sought to characterize the sequence diversity at early infection, between two distinct anatomical sites; the female reproductive tract vs. systemic compartment. We recruited 72 women from Uganda and Zimbabwe within seven months of HIV-1 infection. Using next generation deep sequencing, we analyzed the total genetic diversity within the C2-V3-C3 envelope region of HIV-1 isolated from the female genital tract at early infection and compared this to the diversity of HIV-1 in plasma. We then compared intra-patient viral diversity in matched cervical and blood samples with three or seven months post infection. Genetic analysis of the C2-V3-C3 region of HIV-1 env revealed that early HIV-1 isolates within blood displayed a more homogeneous genotype (mean 1.67 clones, range 1-5 clones) than clones in the female genital tract (mean 5.7 clones, range 3-10 clones) (p<0.0001). The higher env diversity observed within the genital tract compared to plasma was independent of HIV-1 subtype (A, C and D). Our analysis of early mucosal infections in women revealed high HIV-1 diversity in the vaginal tract but few transmitted clones in the blood. These novel in vivo finding suggest a possible mucosal sieve effect, leading to the establishment of a homogenous systemic infection.\n",

      "Samples were obtained from 24 individuals (18 from the US, 6 from South Africa); these individuals were classified as having acute infection based on the following criteria: positive qualitative RNA assay; two negative rapid tests; negative discriminatory test. The samples were tested with the BioPlex assay, the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo test, the Bio-Rad GS HIV Combo Ag-Ab EIA test, and a viral load assay.\n",
      "Twelve (50.0%) of 24 samples had RNA detected only ( > 40 to 13,476 copies/mL). Ten (43.5%) samples had reactive results with all three Ag/Ab assays, one sample was reactive with the ARCHITECT and Bio-Rad assays, and one sample was reactive with the Bio-Rad and BioPlex assays. The 11 samples that were reactive with the BioPlex assay had viral loads from 83,010 to >750,000 copies/mL; 9/11 samples were classified as Ag positive/Ab negative by the BioPlex assay.\n",
      "Detection of acute HIV infection was similar for the BioPlex assay and two other Ag/Ab assays. All three tests were less sensitive than a qualitative RNA assay and only detected HIV Ag when the viral load was high. The BioPlex assay detected acute infection in about half of the cases, and identified most of those infections as Ag positive/Ab negative.\n",
      "Disclosing HIV status to children before adolescence is a major challenge facing families and healthcare providers. This study used a mixed methods approach to explore the youth perspective of how youth living with HIV (YLHIV) found out their status and to quantify the association of disclosure modality with mental health, stigma, adherence, and HIV outcomes in adolescence. Youth 11-24 years of age attending adolescent HIV clinic in Moshi, Tanzania were included. Adolescents answered questions, including when and how they found out they had HIV, mental health surveys (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and modified University of California Los Angeles trauma screen), modified Berger's stigma scale, and self-reported adherence. HIV-1 RNA and latest CD4 were obtained. In-depth interviews were conducted using a convenience sample. The majority of youth reported that they found out their HIV status on their own (80%). Youth attending the government site were less likely to be purposefully told their HIV status compared with those attending the referral site (p < 0.01). Depressive and emotional/behavioral symptoms, internal stigma, and incomplete adherence were significantly more likely among those who figured out their HIV status on their own as compared with those who were purposefully told. Youth discussed how they figured out their HIV status on their own during in-depth interviews. These findings demonstrated that youth who figured out their HIV status on their own had increased mental health symptoms and worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is imperative to implement disclosure protocols in early childhood to reduce mental health difficulties, internal stigma, and promote ART adherence in YLHIV.\n",
      "Accurate HIV-1 incidence estimation is critical to the success of HIV-1 prevention strategies. Current assays are limited by high false recent rates (FRRs) in certain populations and a short mean duration of recent infection (MDRI). Dynamic early HIV-1 antibody response kinetics were harnessed to identify biomarkers for improved incidence assays. We conducted retrospective analyses on circulating antibodies from known recent and longstanding infections and evaluated binding and avidity measurements of Env and non-Env antigens and multiple antibody forms (i.e., IgG, IgA, IgG3, IgG4, dIgA, and IgM) in a diverse panel of 164 HIV-1-infected participants (clades A, B, C). Discriminant function analysis identified an optimal set of measurements that were subsequently evaluated in a 324-specimen blinded biomarker validation panel. These biomarkers included clade C gp140 IgG3, transmitted/founder clade C gp140 IgG4 avidity, clade B gp140 IgG4 avidity, and gp41 immunodominant region IgG avidity. MDRI was estimated at 215 day or alternatively, 267 days. FRRs in untreated and treated subjects were 5.0% and 3.6%, respectively. Thus, computational analysis of dynamic HIV-1 antibody isotype and antigen interactions during infection enabled design of a promising HIV-1 recency assay for improved cross-sectional incidence estimation.\n",
      "The acute phase of HIV infection is characterized by massive depletion of CD4 T cells, high viral plasma levels and pronounced systemic immune activation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have the potential to control systemic immune activation but also to suppress antigen specific T and B cell response. The co-expression of FoxP3 and Helios transcription factors, has been described for identification of highly suppressive Tregs. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype of classic Tregs during early HIV infection, and to assess the correlations between the frequencies and phenotype of Tregs with the plasma viral load, CD4 counts, immune activation and the frequency of antibodies reactive to HIV-1 proteins, measured by an immunochromatographic test.\n",
      "The relative frequency of classic Tregs cells in peripheral blood correlated positively with HIV viral load and immune activation of CD8 T cells, and inversely with absolute CD4 counts and development of anti-HIV antibodies in subjects with early HIV infection. However, the expression of Helios in classic Tregs was inversely correlated with viral replication and immune activation, and positively with recovery of CD4 T cell counts and appearance of antibodies reactive to HIV-1 proteins.\n",
      "These results raise the hypothesis that classic Tregs are inefficient at controlling systemic immune activation in subjects with early HIV infection and may be associated with delayed production of antibodies against HIV proteins, delaying the control of viral replication. Conversely, Helios expressing Tregs might contribute to control of viral replication by mechanisms involving the limitation of systemic immune activation.\n",

      "Retrospective survival analysis of routinely collected clinical data of HIV-infected patients with clinically diagnosed KS, receiving ART and chemotherapy consisting of a combination of bleomycin and vincristine at the Donka National Hospital in Conakry between 2012 and 2015.\n",
      "A total of 225 patients were enrolled for KS treatment within the three-year period. Late presentation with stage T1 disease was common (82.7%). At the end of a median of 8 cycles of chemotherapy (IQR: 2-12), complete remission was observed in 65 (28.9%), partial remission in 53 (23.6%), stable disease in 15 (6.7%) and unknown response for all 92 (40.9%) patients who dropped out of care. The chances of achieving complete remission doubled after each additional cycle of chemotherapy (aOR = 2.09 95% CI: 1.44-3.01) but were reduced by about two-thirds for each additional month delay between treatment and onset of KS (aOR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11-0.86). Treatment response was seriously compromised in patients with woody skin oedema (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01-0.38) and those with prior chemotherapy (aOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80). The median survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.9-9.8). Attrition from care was reduced by 22% for every additional cycle of chemotherapy administered (aH0R = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.71-0.84) and was lower in those with complete remission compared with those with partial or no response (aHR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.007-0.43).\n",
      "There has been an increased access to KS treatment. The overall response rate is 52.4%, which is considered a satisfactory result. Poor outcomes were common and were largely due to late presentation and defaulting on treatment. Efforts towards early HIV/KS diagnosis and adherence to a full round of chemotherapy are needed for optimising outcomes. Newer drugs may be required for patients previously exposed to chemotherapy.\n",

We assessed cost-effectiveness of adding HIVST to existing facility-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services.

      "From the health provider perspective and 20-year time horizon, facility HTC using 2010 WHO ART guidelines was the least costly ($294.71 per person; 95% credible interval [CrI], 270.79-318.45) and least effective (11.64 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] per person; 95% CrI, 11.43-11.86) strategy. Compared with this strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for facility HTC using 2015 WHO ART guidelines was $226.85 (95% CrI, 198.79-284.35) per QALY gained. The strategy of facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2010 WHO ART guidelines, was extendedly dominated. The ICER for facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2015 WHO ART guidelines, was $253.90 (95% CrI, 201.71-342.02) per QALY gained compared with facility HTC and using 2015 WHO ART guidelines.\n",

      "Persons in the early stages of HIV infection are the major drivers of new infections. These individuals may also develop renal dysfunctions at this time. Nigeria, as other African countries, has one of the highest prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV infections. Despite this, limited information exists on early HIV detection in the continent. This may be related to difficulties in providing early HIV diagnosis and treatment. Patients referred for malaria testing may provide a unique opportunity for early HIV detection. In this study, a method for identifying early HIV-infected individuals was assessed. HIV-1 subtype and renal function biomarkers were also analyzed in these persons. To identify early HIV infection, over a period of 18 months blood samples were collected from persons referred by clinicians for malaria parasite tests in Nigeria. A total of 671 samples were collected and analyzed for HIV antigen/antibody and subtypes. 101 of these samples were categorized into one of four groups: early HIV, chronic HIV, malaria infection and control groups for renal function analysis. 29% of HIV infected individuals were at the early stages of infection. The predominant subtype detected was CRF02_AG (57.14%). The early HIV group had the highest mean serum creatinine (95 µmol/L) and urea (5.7 mmol/L) values across all groups with the difference significant at P < 0.05. There was no significant difference between the circulating subtype and the stage of HIV infection. Our results show the feasibility of screening persons referred for malaria tests for early HIV. This can be used to control new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection substantially increases the risk of developing tuberculosis. There is extensive depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells in blood during early HIV infection, but little is known about responses in the lungs at this stage. Given that mucosal organs are a principal target for HIV-mediated CD4+ T-cell destruction, we investigated M. tuberculosis-specific responses in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from persons with latent M. tuberculosis infection and untreated HIV coinfection with preserved CD4+ T-cell counts. M. tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T-cell cytokine (interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 2) responses were discordant in frequency and function between BAL and blood. Responses in BAL were 15-fold lower in HIV-infected persons as compared to uninfected persons (P = .048), whereas blood responses were 2-fold lower (P = .006). However, an increase in T cells in the airways in HIV-infected persons resulted in the overall number of M. tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells in BAL being similar. Our study highlights the important insights gained from studying M. tuberculosis immunity at the site of disease during HIV infection.\n",
      "Symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome (ARS) may be used to identify patients with acute HIV-1 infection who seek care. ARS symptoms in African adults differ by region. We assessed whether reporting of ARS was associated with HIV-1 subtype in a multicentre African cohort study representing countries with predominant HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D.\n",
      "ARS symptoms were assessed in adults enrolling within 6 weeks after the estimated date of infection in an acute and early HIV-1 infection cohort study. HIV-1 subtype was determined by POL genotyping. We used log-binomial regression to compare ARS symptom prevalence among those with subtype A vs. C or D, adjusting for sex, time since enrolment, and enrolment viral load.\n",
      "Among 183 volunteers ascertained within 6 weeks after estimated date of infection, 77 (42.0%) had subtype A, 83 (45.4%) subtype C, and 23 (12.6%) subtype D infection. Individuals with subtype A were 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.68) times as likely as individuals with subtypes C or D to report any ARS symptoms; each individual symptom other than rash was also more prevalent in subtype A than in subtype C or D, with prevalence ratios ranging from 1.94 (1.40, 2.70) for headache to 4.92 (2.24, 10.78) for lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "Individuals with subtype A were significantly more likely than individuals with subtypes C or D to report any ARS symptoms. HIV-1 subtypes may help explain differences in ARS that have been observed across regions in Africa, and may impact the yield of symptom-based screening strategies for acute HIV infection detection.\n",

      "Immunological events in acute HIV-1 infection before peak viremia (hyperacute phase) may contribute to the development of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used pre-infection and acute-infection peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma samples from 22 women, including 10 who initiated antiretroviral treatment in Fiebig stages I-V of acute infection to study B cell subsets and B-cell associated cytokines (BAFF and CXCL13) kinetics for up to ~90 days post detection of plasma viremia. Frequencies of B cell subsets were defined by flow cytometry while plasma cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. We observed a rapid but transient increase in exhausted tissue-like memory, activated memory, and plasmablast B cells accompanied by decline in resting memory cells in untreated, but not treated women. B cell subset frequencies in untreated women positively correlated with viral loads but did not predict emergence of cross-neutralizing antibodies measured 12 months post detection of plasma viremia. Plasma BAFF and CXCL13 levels increased only in untreated women, but their levels did not correlate with viral loads. Importantly, early CXCL13 but not BAFF levels predicted the later emergence of detectable cross-neutralizing antibodies at 12 months post detection of plasma viremia. Thus, hyperacute HIV-1 infection is associated with B cell subset changes, which do not predict emergence of cross-neutralizing antibodies. However, plasma CXCL13 levels during hyperacute infection predicted the subsequent emergence of cross-neutralizing antibodies, providing a potential biomarker for the evaluation of vaccines designed to elicit cross-neutralizing activity or for natural infection studies to explore mechanisms underlying development of neutralizing antibodies.\n",
      "Acute HIV infection (AHI) is the period prior to seroconversion characterized by high viral replication, hyper-transmission potential and commonly, non-specific febrile illness. AHI detection requires HIV-RNA viral load (VL) determination, which has very limited access in low-income countries due to restrictive costs and implementation constraints. We sought to identify a biomarker that could enable AHI diagnosis in scarce-resource settings, and to evaluate the feasibility of its implementation. HIV-seronegative adults presenting at the Manhiça District Hospital, Mozambique, with reported-fever were tested for VL. Plasma levels of 49 inflammatory biomarkers from AHI (n = 61) and non-HIV infected outpatients (n = 65) were determined by Luminex and ELISA. IP-10 demonstrated the best predictive power for AHI detection (AUC = 0.88 [95%CI 0.80-0.96]). A cut-off value of IP-10 ≥ 161.6 pg/mL provided a sensitivity of 95.5% (95%CI 85.5-99.5) and a specificity of 76.5% (95%CI 62.5-87.2). The implementation of an IP-10 screening test could avert from 21 to 84 new infections and save from US$176,609 to US$533,467 to the health system per 1,000 tested patients. We conclude that IP-10 is an accurate biomarker to screen febrile HIV-seronegative individuals for subsequent AHI diagnosis with VL. Such an algorithm is a cost-effective strategy to prevent disease progression and a substantial number of further HIV infections.\n",
      "In order to inform the rational design of HIV-1 preventive and cure interventions it is critical to understand the events occurring during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI). Using viral deep sequencing on six participants from the early capture acute infection RV217 cohort, we have studied HIV-1 evolution in plasma collected twice weekly during the first weeks following the advent of viremia. The analysis of infections established by multiple transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses revealed novel viral profiles that included: a) the low-level persistence of minor T/F variants, b) the rapid replacement of the major T/F by a minor T/F, and c) an initial expansion of the minor T/F followed by a quick collapse of the same minor T/F to low frequency. In most participants, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape was first detected at the end of peak viremia downslope, proceeded at higher rates than previously measured in HIV-1 infection, and usually occurred through the exploration of multiple mutational pathways within an epitope. The rapid emergence of CTL escape variants suggests a strong and early CTL response. Minor T/F viral strains can contribute to rapid and varied profiles of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution during AHI. Overall, our results demonstrate that early, deep, and frequent sampling is needed to investigate viral/host interaction during AHI, which could help identify prerequisites for prevention and cure of HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "HIV rapid antibody tests are widely used in Africa, but dual testing sometimes produces discordant results. It is not clear if discordant rapid HIV tests should always heighten suspicion by frontline health workers that early HIV infection is present. Some studies have reported that discordant rapid tests have value for identifying early HIV infection in high HIV prevalence populations. It is not known if rapid test performance influenced this conclusion, or if this observation will hold true for low HIV prevalence populations. We therefore explored the occurrence of discordant rapid HIV tests in a low-resource community.\n",
      "A cross-sectional sample of HIV status-unaware adults with recent exposure to unsafe sex was assessed using a validated risk-based tool (University of North Carolina (UNC)-Malawi Risk Screening Score) for acute HIV infection.

The proportion of early HIV testing was significantly better in the lower 40% wealth group compared with the higher 40% wealth group (p value=0.040).

This socioeconomic difference could contribute to fast-tracking EMTCT given the high HIV prevalence among the lower wealth group.

      "The unchanged global HIV incidence may be related to ignoring acute HIV infection (AHI). This scoping review examines diagnostic, clinical, and public health implications of identifying and treating persons with AHI.\n",
      "We searched PubMed, in addition to hand-review of key journals identifying research pertaining to AHI detection and treatment. We focused on the relative contribution of AHI to transmission and the diagnostic, clinical, and public health implications. We prioritized research from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) published in the last fifteen years.\n",
      "Extensive AHI research and limited routine AHI detection and treatment have begun in LMIC. Diagnostic challenges include ease-of-use, suitability for application and distribution in LMIC, and throughput for high-volume testing. Risk score algorithms have been used in LMIC to screen for AHI among individuals with behavioural and clinical characteristics more often associated with AHI. However, algorithms have not been implemented outside research settings. From a clinical perspective, there are substantial immunological and virological benefits to identifying and treating persons with AHI - evading the irreversible damage to host immune systems and seeding of viral reservoirs that occurs during untreated acute infection. The therapeutic benefits require rapid initiation of antiretrovirals, a logistical challenge in the absence of point-of-care testing. From a public health perspective, AHI diagnosis and treatment is critical to: decrease transmission via viral load reduction and behavioural interventions; improve pre-exposure prophylaxis outcomes by avoiding treatment initiation for HIV-seronegative persons with AHI; and, enhance partner services via notification for persons recently exposed or likely transmitting.\n",
      "There are undeniable clinical and public health benefits to AHI detection and treatment, but also substantial diagnostic and logistical barriers to implementation and scale-up. Effective early ART initiation may be critical for HIV eradication efforts, but widespread use in LMIC requires simple and accurate diagnostic tools. Implementation research is critical to facilitate sustainable integration of AHI detection and treatment into existing health systems and will be essential for prospective evaluation of testing algorithms, point-of-care diagnostics, and efficacious and effective first-line regimens.\n",

Attrition from the ART program was 36.7% at 12 months (95% CI: 35.9-37.5%). Option B+ patients had the highest level of attrition at 50.4% at 12 months (95% CI: 48.6-52.3%). While early HIV disease stage at ART initiation was protective among non-pregnant women and men, it was a strong risk factor among Option B+ clients. In adjusted analyses, key protective factors were older age (p < 0.0001), living near the health facility (p = 0.04), having another known HIV-positive household member (p < 0.0001), having greater body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.0001), pre-ART counseling (p < 0.0001), and Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis during baseline (p < 0.01).

      "A risk score for possible AHI based on literature and expert opinion - including symptoms associated with AHI and early HIV-1 - was evaluated using data from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies among men who have sex with men (MSM). Subsequently, we optimized the risk score by constructing two multivariable logistic regression models: one including only symptoms and one combining symptoms with known risk factors for HIV-1 seroconversion, using generalized estimating equations. Several risk scores were generated from these models and the optimal risk score was validated using data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.\n",
      "Using data from 1562 MSM with 175 HIV-1 seroconversion visits and 17,271 seronegative visits in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies, the optimal risk score included four symptoms (oral thrush, fever, lymphadenopathy, weight loss) and three risk factors (self-reported gonorrhea, receptive condomless anal intercourse, more than five sexual partners, all in the preceding six months) and yielded an AUC of 0.82. Sensitivity was 76.3% and specificity 76.3%. Validation in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study resulted in an AUC of 0.78, sensitivity of 56.2% and specificity of 88.8%.\n",
      "The optimal risk score had good overall performance in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies and performed comparable (but showed lower sensitivity) in the validation study.

Volunteers at high risk for HIV-1 infection were recruited from study sites in Thailand, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya with high HIV-1 prevalence rates among the populations examined. Small-volume blood samples were collected by finger stick at twice-weekly intervals and tested with the Aptima assay. Participants with reactive Aptima test results were contacted immediately for entry into a more comprehensive follow-up schedule with frequent blood draws. Evaluation of the Aptima test prior to use in this study showed a detection sensitivity of 5.5 copies/ml (50%), with all major HIV-1 subtypes detected. A total of 54,306 specimens from 1,112 volunteers were examined during the initial study period (August 2009 to November 2010); 27 individuals were identified as converting from uninfected to infected status. A sporadic reactive Aptima signal was observed in HIV-1-infected individuals under antiretroviral therapy. Occasional false-reactive Aptima results in uninfected individuals, or nonreactive results in HIV-1-infected individuals not on therapy, were observed and used to calculate assay sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima assay were 99.03% and 99.23%, respectively; positive and negative predictive values were 92.01% and 99.91%, respectively. Conversion from HIV-1-uninfected to -infected status was rapid, with no evidence of a prolonged period of intermittent low-level viremia.\n",

      "This study includes all HIV-infected Dutch and Flemish donors in the period 2005 to 2014 (n = 55). Part of the HIV polymerase (pol) gene was amplified, sequenced, and compared with more than 10,000 HIV strains obtained from HIV-infected Dutch and Flemish patients. The most likely transmission route was determined based on HIV phylogeny and the donor's self-reported risk behavior during the exit interview.\n",
      "HIV-infected donors were predominantly male (69%), were repeat donors (73%), were born in the Netherlands or Belgium (95%), and harbored HIV Subtype B (68%). Seventy-five percent of HIV-infected male donors were part of robust phylogenetic clusters linked to male-to-male sex, while only 24% of HIV-infected male donors reported male-to-male sex during posttest counseling. Sex between men and women accounted for 13% of HIV infections in male donors and 93% of HIV infections in female donors based on phylogenetic analysis. Only 40% of HIV-infected female donors had HIV Subtype B; 65% of female donors reported a foreign partner and indeed HIV sequences interspersed with sequences from HIV-endemic areas abroad, in particular sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "HIV typing helps to understand HIV transmission routes in donor populations. We found substantial underreporting of male-to-male sex among HIV-infected male donors. Donor education on HIV risk factors and the danger of window-period donations and a donor environment that encourages frank disclosure of sexual behavior will contribute to a decrease of HIV-infected donors.\n",
      "Late presentation for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care is a major impediment for the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes. The role that stigma plays as a potential barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment of HIV among people living with HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is ambivalent. This review aimed to assess the best available evidence regarding the association between perceived HIV related stigma and time to present for HIV/AIDS care.\n",
      "Quantitative studies conducted in English language between 2002 and 2016 that evaluated the association between HIV related stigma and late presentation for HIV care were sought across four major databases. This review considered studies that included the following outcome: 'late HIV testing', 'late HIV diagnosis' and 'late presentation for HIV care after testing'. Data were extracted using a standardized Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. Meta- analysis was undertaken using Revman-5 software. I2 and chi-square test were used to assess heterogeneity. Summary statistics were expressed as pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding p-value.\n",
      "Ten studies from low- and middle- income countries met the search criteria, including six (6) and four (4) case control studies and cross-sectional studies respectively. The total sample size in the included studies was 3,788 participants. Half (5) of the studies reported a significant association between stigma and late presentation for HIV care. The meta-analytical association showed that people who perceived high HIV related stigma had two times more probability of late presentation for HIV care than who perceived low stigma (pooled odds ratio = 2.4; 95%CI: 1.6-3.6, I2 = 79%).\n",
      "High perceptions of HIV related stigma influenced timely presentation for HIV care. In order to avoid late HIV care presentation due the fear of stigma among patients, health professionals should play a key role in informing and counselling patients on the benefits of early HIV testing or early entry to HIV care. Additionally, linking the systems and positive case tracing after HIV testing should be strengthened.\n",

During the trial, HIV seroconversion was diagnosed on site using a testing algorithm with simple/rapid tests (SRTs) and confirmed with a gold standard testing algorithm (see short communication: Fig. 1). The infection date was determined more accurately by the use of standard ELISAs and Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) in a look-back procedure. For this sub-study, the international central laboratory repeated the study algorithm using SRTs.\n",
      "A total of 83 pre-seroconversions specimens from 61 seroconverters were analyzed in a look-back procedure. RNA was detected in 35/61 seroconverters at the visit before the seroconversion visit as determined at the study sites. Four seroconversion dates were inaccurate at one study site as the international central laboratory detected the HIV infection one visit earlier using the same test algorithm. Using the gold standard, an additional seroconversion was detected at an earlier visit. The combined antigen/antibody and the single antigen test had a higher sensitivity compared to the SRTs in detecting acute infections.\n",
      "In the FEM-PrEP trial, the international central laboratory detected a small number of seroconversions one month earlier than the study sites using the same study algorithm. Standard tests are still the most sensitive tests in detecting pre-seroconversion or acute HIV infection, but they are costly, time consuming and not recommended for use on-site in a clinical trial.\n",

We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of implementing CRAG screening using the recently developed CRAG lateral flow assay in Uganda compared to current practice without screening.\n",
      "A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare two strategies for cryptococcal prevention among people living with HIV with CD4 < 100 in Uganda: No cryptococcal screening vs. CRAG screening with WHO-recommended preemptive treatment for CRAG-positive patients. The model was constructed to reflect primary HIV clinics in Uganda, with a cohort of HIV-infected patients with CD4 < 100 cells/uL. Primary outcomes were expected costs, DALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We evaluated varying levels of programmatic implementation in secondary analysis.\n",
      "CRAG screening was considered highly cost-effective and was associated with an ICER of $6.14 per DALY averted compared to no screening (95% uncertainty range: $-20.32 to $36.47). Overall, implementation of CRAG screening was projected to cost $1.52 more per person, and was projected to result in a 40% relative reduction in cryptococcal-associated mortality. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CRAG screening was cost-effective in 100% of scenarios and cost saving (ie cheaper and more effective than no screening) in 30% of scenarios. Secondary analysis projected a total cost of $651,454 for 100% implementation of screening nationally, while averting 1228 deaths compared to no screening.\n",

      "Early growth of HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) children is poorer than that of their HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) counterparts but there is little longitudinal or longer term information about the growth effects of early HIV exposure.\n",
      "We performed a longitudinal analysis to compare growth of HEU and HUU infants and children using data from two cohort studies in Lusaka, Zambia. Initially 207 HUU and 200 HEU infants from the Breastfeeding and Postpartum Health (BFPH) study and 580 HUU and 165 HEU from the Chilenje Infant Growth, Nutrition and Infection Study (CIGNIS) had anthropometric measurements taken during infancy and again when school-aged, at which time 66 BFPH children and 326 CIGNIS children were available. We analysed the data from the two cohorts separately using linear mixed models. Linear regression models were used as a secondary analysis at the later time points, adjusting for breastfeeding duration. We explored when the main group differences in growth emerged in order to estimate the largest 'effect periods'.\n",
      "After adjusting for socioeconomic status and maternal education, HEU children had lower weight-for-age, length-for-age and BMI-for-age Z-scores during early growth and these differences still existed when children were school-aged. Exposure group differences changed most between 1 and 6 weeks and between 18 months and ~7.5 years.\n",

      "The Prevention of Mother to Child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, an important intervention in the fight against HIV/AIDS can only be of benefit if the HIV status of the mother is known. Unfortunately, some women receive HIV counseling and testing (HCT) during the window period or prior to new infection in pregnancy and therefore, miss-out on the gains of PMTCT. A repeat HIV test would identify this later seroconversion and ensure early intervention. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of HIV seroconversion during pregnancy and assessing the factors associated with HIV seroconversion in clients who attended ante-natal clinic (ANC) in University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo.\n",

Adolescents were less likely to present with known HIV status (aRR = 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.29 to 0.41) but equally likely to be HIV tested in ANC. HIV prevalence was 5.5% in adolescents vs 20.1% in adults.

      "During acute HIV infection, HIV actively replicates but seroconversion has not yet occurred. Primary HIV infection (PHI) is characterized by a transient nonspecific febrile illness, a massive inflammatory response, and the progressive appearance of anti-HIV-specific antibodies. In this study, we have identified patterns of inflammatory biomarkers associated with the innate immunological reaction before completion of a full humoral response.\n",
      "A symptom-based screening was used to identify acute HIV infection in the Manhiça District Hospital in Mozambique. Plasma levels of biomarkers were determined by Luminex and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-HIV antibodies were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blot. Statistical analyses used random forest and logistic regression models.\n",
      "Of 3116 rapid test seronegative or indeterminate individuals, 85 (2.7%) had positive plasma HIV viral load and were enrolled as PHI, of which n = 45 (52.9%), n = 8 (9.4%), n = 12 (14.1%), and n = 20 (23.5%) were classified as Fiebig I-III, IV, V, and VI stages, respectively, by Western blot. Comparison of individuals at early (Fiebig I-IV) and late (Fiebig V-VI) immune stages identified significant differences in the expression level of plasma B-cell activating factor , monocyte chemotactic protein-1, sCD163, and monokine induced by interferon (IFN-γ). This cytokine signature classified patients in the preseroconversion phase with a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 81.2% CONCLUSIONS:: Identification of a cytokine signature specific for the preseroconversion stage of PHI may help to understand the earliest HIV pathogenic events and identify new potential targets for immunotherapy aimed at modulating the cytokine response to HIV infection.\n",

      "Primary HIV drug resistant mutations are mutations that occur in an HIV-infected individual prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). These mutations may arise by de novo mutagenesis or result from transmission. Drug resistant mutations (DRMs) may reduce the effectiveness of ART leading to inadequate virological outcomes. Currently, Sanger sequencing is the standard method for detection of DRMs to inform treatment decisions, but does not detect minor variant mutations. Drug resistant minority variants (DRMVs) can be detected by next generation sequencing (NGS). However, several challenges including cost of infrastructure and the need for complex data analysis bioinformatics tools remain major setbacks for NGS use. More importantly, the clinical impact of DRMVs on ART is not well understood, underscoring the importance for understanding whether the levels of primary DRMVs for different mutations impact on the effectiveness of ART and the rationale for inclusion in routine diagnostics. Understanding the impact of primary DRMVs will help inform how NGS may be utilized in the future for pre-emptive clinical ART decision making.\n",
      "HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is of increasing public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa with the rollout of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Such data are, however, limited in Kenya, where HIV-1 drug resistance testing is not routinely performed. From a population-based household survey conducted between September and November 2012 in rural western Kenya, we retrospectively assessed HIV-1 TDR baseline rates, its determinants, and genetic diversity among drug-naïve persons aged 15-59 years with acute HIV-1 infections (AHI) and recent HIV-1 infections (RHI) as determined by nucleic acid amplification test and both Limiting Antigen and BioRad avidity immunoassays, respectively. HIV-1 pol sequences were scored for drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb and WHO 2009 mutation guidelines. HIV-1 subtyping was computed in MEGA6. Eighty seven (93.5%) of the eligible samples were successfully sequenced. Of these, 8 had at least one TDR mutation, resulting in a TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7-17.1). No TDR was observed among persons with AHI (n = 7). TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI 1.8-11.2) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.9% (95% CI 3.2-14.2) for non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.2) for protease inhibitors. Three (3.4% 95% CI 0.8-10.1) persons had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Predominant TDR mutations in the reverse transcriptase included K103N/S (4.6%) and M184V (2.3%); only M46I/L (1.1%) occurred in the protease. All the eight persons were predicted to have different grades of resistance to the ARV regimens, ranging from potential low-level to high-level resistance. HIV-1 subtype distribution was heterogeneous: A (57.5%), C (6.9%), D (21.8%), G (2.3%), and circulating recombinant forms (11.5%). Only low CD4 count was associated with TDR (p = 0.0145). Our findings warrant the need for enhanced HIV-1 TDR monitoring in order to inform on population-based therapeutic guidelines and public health interventions.\n",
      "Intrahost human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 diversity increases linearly over time. We assessed the extent to which mean pairwise distances and the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) inferred from intrahost HIV-1C env sequences were associated with the estimated time of HIV infection. Data from a primary HIV-1C infection study in Botswana were used for this analysis (N = 42). A total of 2540 HIV-1C env gp120 variable loop region 1 to conserved region 5 (V1C5) of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 viral sequences were generated by single genome amplification and sequencing, with an average of 61 viral sequences per participant and 11 sequences per time point per participant. Raw pairwise distances were calculated for each time point and participant using the ape package in R software. The tMRCA was estimated using phylogenetic inference implemented in Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees v1.8.2. Pairwise distances and tMRCA were significantly associated with the estimated time since HIV infection (both P < 0.001). Taking into account multiplicity of HIV infection strengthened these associations. HIV-1C env-based pairwise distances and tMRCA can be used as potential markers for HIV recency. However, the tMRCA estimates demonstrated no advantage over the pairwise distances estimates.\n",
      "The structure of the sexual network of a population plays an essential role in the transmission of HIV. Concurrent partnerships, i.e. partnerships that overlap in time, are important in determining this network structure. Men and women may differ in their concurrent behavior, e.g. in the case of polygyny where women are monogamous while men may have concurrent partnerships. Polygyny has been shown empirically to be negatively associated with HIV prevalence, but the epidemiological impacts of other forms of gender-asymmetric concurrency have not been formally explored. Here we investigate how gender asymmetry in concurrency, including polygyny, can affect the disease dynamics. We use a model for a dynamic network where individuals may have concurrent partners. The maximum possible number of simultaneous partnerships can differ for men and women, e.g. in the case of polygyny. We control for mean partnership duration, mean lifetime number of partners, mean degree, and sexually active lifespan. We assess the effects of gender asymmetry in concurrency on two epidemic phase quantities (R\n",

      "The prevalence of major depressive disorder in this study was 14.0% [95% CI 11.7-6.3%] while that of 'moderate to high risk for suicidality' was 2.8% [95% CI 1.7%; 3.9%]. Multivariable analyses found that factors in the socio-demographic, vulnerability/protective and stress (only for major depressive disorder) domains were significantly associated with both major depressive disorder and 'moderate to high risk for suicidality'. Major depressive disorder but not 'moderate to high risk for suicidality' was significantly associated with impaired psychosocial functioning, greater utilisation of health services and non-adherence to septrin/dasone. Neither major depressive disorder nor 'moderate to high risk for suicidality' was associated with CD4 counts, risky sexual behaviour nor with non-utilisation of condoms.\n",

      "The magnitude of concurrent malaria infection and the impact it has on hematological abnormalities, such as anemia in people living with HIV/AIDS, is not well studied in Ethiopian set up. In this cross sectional study, therefore, we assessed the prevalence of concurrent malaria infection and anemia among highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) naive people living with HIV/AIDS between October, 2012 to May, 2013 in Northern Ethiopia. After obtaining consent, socio demographic, clinical, immunological and behavioural data was obtained. The overall prevalence of concomitant malaria infection was 17.4%. Rural residents and low to middle income class clients were more frequently co-infected with malaria (p<0.0001). Utilization of insecticide treated nets (p=0.0002) and co-trimoxazole intake (p=0.006) were protective factors against Plasmodium infection. The overall prevalence of anemia was also high (43%), being significantly higher (91.3%) in malaria positive people living with HIV/AIDS compared to malaria free HIV patients (32.8%) (p<0.0001). Female gender (p=0.011), history of opportunistic infections (P=0.0027) and late HIV stages (III and IV) (p=0.0001) were also significantly associated with anemia in HIV patients. In conclusion, concurrent malaria represents a common condition and there was a significant difference in the odds of anemia between malaria positive and negative people living with HIV/AIDS in Northern Ethiopia indicating a need for routine screening of people living with HIV/AIDS living in malaria endemic-areas and close monitoring of co-infected patients. Indeed utilization of ITNs, malaria prophylaxis and early HIV diagnosis are highly encouraged in people living with HIV/AIDS.\n",
      "We develop a within host mathematical model of HIV-1 infection describing the effects of combined RTIs and PIs treatments on early HIV-1 infection when treatment is captured using periodic functions of pharmacokinetics type. We use an alternative of the basic reproduction number to analyze endemicity level of HIV-1 infection. Various treatment scenarios incorporating perfect and imperfect drug adherence in drug administration are explored. Our results show that pharmacokinetics treatment is a more realistic way of administering the treatment. Apart from confirming that PIs drugs are more effective than RTIs drugs and that combined RTIs and PIs therapy is more effective than monotherapy of RTIs or PIs, our results show that imperfect drug adherence leads to the increase of viral in the absence of mutation even though the drug is good.\n",
      "In the quest to achieve early HIV treatment goals, national HIV treatment programmes dependent on international funding have been dramatically redesigned over the last 5 years. Bottlenecks in treatment provision are conceived of as health system problems to be addressed via structural and logistical fixes (routine HIV testing, point-of-care equipment, nurse-led antiretroviral treatment initiation, and patient tracking). Patient perspectives are rarely taken into account when such fixes are being considered. Patients' therapeutic experiences often remain at the periphery during the planning stage and are only considered within the context of monitoring and evaluation audits once programmes are up and running.\n",
      "Ethnographic research was conducted in five clinics in Swaziland between 2012 and 2014. Participatory approaches were used to collect data; the first author trained as an HIV counsellor in order to collect observational data on the continuum of care, and conducted in-depth interviews with interlocutors involved at the different phases.\n",
      "Although recently adopted global HIV strategies have proven effective in scaling up treatment in Swaziland, our research demonstrates that the effort to expand services rapidly and to meet donor targets has also undermined patients' therapeutic experiences and overtaxed health workers, both of which are counterproductive to the ultimate goal of treatment scale-up. This article provides a perspective beyond the structural elements that impede universal treatment, and explores patient views and experiences of the strategies adopted to support further treatment expansion, with a particular focus on the shifting of key care and logistical tasks to expert clients.\n",

      "There is low utilisation of provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) services for infants and children under 5 years old in many low- and middle-income countries including Tanzania. Studies have shown that various factors contribute to low use of PITC, includes the unavailability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and other specialised techniques for testing children less than 18 months old as well as the reluctance of some parents and caregivers to undertake HIV testing for their children because of the fear of stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. This study explored health system barriers at the district and community levels affecting the provision of PITC for infants and children under 5 in Tanzania using a case study of 2 districts.\n",
      "A qualitative study was conducted in 1 urban and 1 rural district in the southern part of Tanzania. In-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and a desk review of documents were used to obtain the information. Respondents were purposively enrolled in the study and thematic analysis was used to generate findings.\n",
      "Provision of PITC services faces a number of district-level health system barriers, including lack of adequate health staff in health facilities both in number and skills, lack of adequate infrastructure, and erratic shortage of supplies. At the community level, community members' low understanding about the importance of PITC services as well as existing stigma associated with HIV/AIDS have constrained the provision of PITC services.\n",
      "This study concludes that for effective implementation of PITC, the health system should strengthen health facilities through training of service providers on PITC, deploying adequately skilled health workers, supplying sufficient medicines and other supplies, and promoting health campaigns focused on educating community members about the importance of early HIV testing for infants and children under 5.\n",
      "This paper seeks to highlight the benefits of prioritizing moderate African communitarian principles as partly demonstrated in the HIV prevention strategies implemented in Uganda in the late 1980s. Pertinent lessons could be drawn so as to achieve the HIV prevention targets envisioned in the post-2015 development era. Communitarianism emphasizes the importance of communities as part of healthy human existence. Its core ethical values include the virtues of generosity, compassion, and solidarity. Persuasion through communication, consensus through dialogue, and the awareness and commitment to responsibilities towards other members of the community, are chief practices relied upon to achieve appropriate social behaviour. All these elements signify individual rootedness in communities and contribute to the healthy existence of its members. Communitarianism is usually classified as either authoritarian/radical or responsive/moderate, depending on the primacy given to either community interests or the individual will and rights. Moderate communitarianism recognizes the individual's capacity for moral reasoning, virtue and free choice. The ensuing form of society is deemed more ethical as it relies on education in the virtues, moral persuasion and informal social controls, without stifling individual identity, agency, and capacity for self-determination. If moderate African communitarianism, in particular, can to a certain extent be associated with the significant aspects of Uganda's HIV prevention strategies in the stated period, then its present-day relevance for HIV prevention and other public health interventions may be emphasized accordingly. This applies especially in view of the ongoing efforts to achieve a balance between individual and collective interests in bioethics.\n",

Overall mortality, attrition and 1-year failure rates were 5.1, 10.8 and 9.0 per 100 person-years, respectively. Immunosuppression, stage 3 or 4, and underweight were associated with increased rates of mortality, attrition and treatment failure. Adjusted estimates showed lower mortality hazard ratios (HR) among children aged 2-4 years (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.77 than children aged 5-14 years). One-year treatment failure incidence rate ratios (IRR) were similar regardless of age (IRR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.67-1.25 for <2 years; 1.01, 95% CI 0.83-1.23 for 2-4 years, vs. 5-14 years).\n",
      "Good treatment outcomes were achieved during the first decade of HIV paediatric care despite the late start of therapy. Encouraging early HIV infant diagnosis in and outside prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes, and linkage to care services for early ART initiation, is needed to reduce mortality and delay treatment failure.\n",
      "Fever is common among patients seeking care in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), but causes other than malaria are rarely diagnosed. We assessed dengue and chikungunya virus infections among young febrile adults evaluated for acute HIV infection (AHI) and malaria in coastal Kenya.\n",
      "We tested plasma samples obtained in a cross-sectional study from febrile adult patients aged 18-35 years evaluated for AHI and malaria at urgent care seeking at seven health facilities in coastal Kenya in 2014-2015. Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were amplified using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. We conducted logistic regression analyses to determine independent predictors of dengue virus infection.\n",
      "489 samples that were negative for both AHI and malaria were tested, of which 43 (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.4-11.7) were positive for DENV infection. No participant was positive for CHIKV infection. DENV infections were associated with clinic visits in the rainy season (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.3-6.5) and evaluation at a private health facility (AOR 5.2, 95% CI: 2.0-13.1) or research health facility (AOR = 25.6, 95% CI: 8.9-73.2) instead of a public health facility.\n",
      "A high prevalence of DENV infections was found in febrile young adult patients evaluated for AHI. Our data suggests that DENV, along with AHI and malaria, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the adult patient seeking care for fever in coastal Kenya.\n",
      "A single viral variant is transmitted in the majority of HIV infections. However, about 20% of heterosexually transmitted HIV infections are caused by multiple viral variants. Detection of transmitted HIV variants is not trivial, as it involves analysis of multiple viral sequences representing intra-host HIV-1 quasispecies.\n",
      "We distinguish two types of multiple virus transmission in HIV infection: (1) HIV transmission from the same source, and (2) transmission from different sources. Viral sequences representing intra-host quasispecies in a longitudinally sampled cohort of 42 individuals with primary HIV-1C infection in Botswana were generated by single-genome amplification and sequencing and spanned the V1C5 region of HIV-1C env gp120. The Maximum Likelihood phylogeny and distribution of pairwise raw distances were assessed at each sampling time point (n = 217; 42 patients; median 5 (IQR: 4-6) time points per patient, range 2-12 time points per patient).\n",
      "Transmission of multiple viral variants from the same source (likely from the partner with established HIV infection) was found in 9 out of 42 individuals (21%; 95 CI 10-37%). HIV super-infection was identified in 2 patients (5%; 95% CI 1-17%) with an estimated rate of 3.9 per 100 person-years. Transmission of multiple viruses combined with HIV super-infection at a later time point was observed in one individual.\n",
      "Multiple HIV lineages transmitted from the same source produce a monophyletic clade in the inferred phylogenetic tree. Such a clade has transiently distinct sub-clusters in the early stage of HIV infection, and follows a predictable evolutionary pathway. Over time, the gap between initially distinct viral lineages fills in and initially distinct sub-clusters converge. Identification of cases with transmission of multiple viral lineages from the same source needs to be taken into account in cross-sectional estimation of HIV recency in epidemiological and population studies.\n",
      "Understanding associations between pregnancy and HIV disease progression is critical to provide appropriate counseling and care to HIV-positive women.\n",
      "From 2006 to 2011, women less than age 40 with incident HIV infection were enrolled in an early HIV infection cohort in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. Time-dependent Cox models evaluated associations between pregnancy and HIV disease progression. Clinical progression was defined as a single CD4 measurement <200 cells/μl, percent CD4 <14%, or category C event, with censoring at antiretroviral (ART) initiation for reasons other than prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Immunologic progression was defined as two consecutive CD4s ≤350 cells/μl or a single CD4 ≤350 cells/μl followed by non-PMTCT ART initiation. Generalized estimating equations assessed changes in CD4 before and after pregnancy.\n",
      "Among 222 women, 63 experienced clinical progression during 783.5 person-years at risk (8.0/100). Among 205 women, 87 experienced immunologic progression during 680.1 person-years at risk (12.8/100). The association between pregnancy and clinical progression was adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2, 1.8. The association between pregnancy and immunologic progression was aHR = 1.7; 95% CI: 0.9, 3.3. Models controlled for age; human leukocyte antigen alleles A*03:01, B*45, B*57; CD4 set point; and HIV-1 subtype. CD4 measurements before versus after pregnancies were not different.\n",
      "In this cohort, pregnancy was not associated with increased clinical or immunologic HIV progression. Similarly, we did not observe meaningful deleterious associations of pregnancy with CD4s. Our findings suggest that HIV-positive women may become pregnant without harmful health effects occurring during the pregnancy. Evaluation of longer-term impact of pregnancy on progression is warranted.\n",
      "Little is known about outcomes after hospitalization for HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. We determined 12-month, posthospital mortality rates in HIV-infected vs. uninfected adults and predictors of mortality.\n",
      "In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled adults admitted to the medical wards of a public hospital in northwestern Tanzania. We conducted standardized questionnaires, physical examinations, and basic laboratory analyses including HIV testing. Participants or proxies were called at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to determine outcomes. Predictors of in-hospital and posthospital mortality were determined using logistic regression. Cox regression models were used to analyze mortality incidence and associated factors. To confirm our findings, we studied adults admitted to another government hospital.\n",
      "We enrolled 637 consecutive adult medical inpatients: 38/143 (26.6%) of the HIV-infected adults died in hospital vs. 104/494 (21.1%) of the HIV-uninfected adults. Twelve-month outcomes were determined for 98/105 (93.3%) vs. 352/390 (90.3%) discharged adults, respectively. Posthospital mortality was 53/105 (50.5%) for HIV-infected adults vs. 126/390 (32.3%) for HIV-uninfected adults (adjusted P = 0.006). The 66/105 (62.9%) HIV-infected adults who attended clinic within 1 month after discharge had significantly lower mortality than the other HIV-infected adults [adjusted hazards ratio = 0.17 (0.07-0.39), P < 0.001]. Adults admitted to a nearby government hospital had similar high rates of posthospital mortality.\n",
      "Posthospital mortality is disturbingly high among HIV-infected adult inpatients in Tanzania. The posthospital period may offer a window of opportunity to improve survival in this population. Interventions are urgently needed and should focus on increasing posthospital linkage to primary HIV care.\n",
      "Randomized-trial data on the risks and benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) as compared with zidovudine and single-dose nevirapine to prevent transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in HIV-infected pregnant women with high CD4 counts are lacking.\n",
      "We randomly assigned HIV-infected women at 14 or more weeks of gestation with CD4 counts of at least 350 cells per cubic millimeter to zidovudine and single-dose nevirapine plus a 1-to-2-week postpartum \"tail\" of tenofovir and emtricitabine (zidovudine alone); zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir-ritonavir (zidovudine-based ART); or tenofovir, emtricitabine, and lopinavir-ritonavir (tenofovir-based ART). The primary outcomes were HIV transmission at 1 week of age in the infant and maternal and infant safety.\n",
      "The median CD4 count was 530 cells per cubic millimeter among 3490 primarily black African HIV-infected women enrolled at a median of 26 weeks of gestation (interquartile range, 21 to 30). The rate of transmission was significantly lower with ART than with zidovudine alone (0.5% in the combined ART groups vs. 1.8%; difference, -1.3 percentage points; repeated confidence interval, -2.1 to -0.4). However, the rate of maternal grade 2 to 4 adverse events was significantly higher with zidovudine-based ART than with zidovudine alone (21.1% vs. 17.3%, P=0.008), and the rate of grade 2 to 4 abnormal blood chemical values was higher with tenofovir-based ART than with zidovudine alone (2.9% vs. 0.8%, P=0.03). Adverse events did not differ significantly between the ART groups (P>0.99). A birth weight of less than 2500 g was more frequent with zidovudine-based ART than with zidovudine alone (23.0% vs. 12.0%, P<0.001) and was more frequent with tenofovir-based ART than with zidovudine alone (16.9% vs. 8.9%, P=0.004); preterm delivery before 37 weeks was more frequent with zidovudine-based ART than with zidovudine alone (20.5% vs. 13.1%, P<0.001). Tenofovir-based ART was associated with higher rates than zidovudine-based ART of very preterm delivery before 34 weeks (6.0% vs. 2.6%, P=0.04) and early infant death (4.4% vs. 0.6%, P=0.001), but there were no significant differences between tenofovir-based ART and zidovudine alone (P=0.10 and P=0.43). The rate of HIV-free survival was highest among infants whose mothers received zidovudine-based ART.\n",
      "Antenatal ART resulted in significantly lower rates of early HIV transmission than zidovudine alone but a higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; PROMISE ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01061151 and NCT01253538 .).\n",
      "A delay presentation for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient's care (that is late engagement to HIV care due to delayed HIV testing or delayed linkage for HIV care after the diagnosis of HIV positive) is a critical step in the series of HIV patient care continuum. In Ethiopia, delayed presentation (DP) for HIV care among vulnerable groups such as tuberculosis (Tb) /HIV co-infected patients has not been assessed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with DP (CD4 < 200 cells/μl at first visit) among Tb/HIV co-infected patients in southwest Ethiopia.\n",
      "A retrospective observational cohort study collated Tb/HIV data from Jimma University Teaching Hospital for the period of September 2010 and August 2012. The data analysis used logistic regression model at P value of ≤ 0.05 in the final model.\n",
      "The prevalence of DP among Tb/HIV co-infected patients was 59.9 %. Tb/HIV co-infected patients who had a house with at least two rooms were less likely (AOR, 0.5; 95 % CI: 0.3-1.0) to present late than those having only single room. Tobacco non-users of Tb/HIV co-infected participants were also 50 % less likely (AOR, 0.5; 95 % CI: 0.3-0.8) to present late for HIV care compared to tobacco users. The relative odds of DP among Tb/HIV co-infected patients with ambulatory (AOR, 1.8; 95 % CI, 1.0-3.1) and bedridden (AOR, 8.3; 95 % CI, 2.8-25.1) functional status was higher than with working status.\n",
      "Three out of five Tb/HIV co-infected patients presented late for HIV care. Higher proportions of DP were observed in bedridden patients, tobacco smokers, and those who had a single room residence. These findings have intervention implications and call for effective management strategies for Tb/HIV co-infection including early HIV diagnosis and early linkage to HIV care services.\n",

      "Longitudinal data from 497 HIV-1 seroconverters allowed us to systematically evaluate the dynamics and correlates of CD8\n",
      "Two thirds of the world's new HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa. Acute HIV infection (AHI) is the time of virus acquisition until the appearance of HIV antibodies. Early HIV infection, which includes AHI, is the interval between virus acquisition and establishment of viral load set-point. This study aimed to detect acute and early HIV infections in a hyper-endemic setting.\n",
      "This was a cross-sectional diagnostic study that enrolled individuals who had negative rapid HIV results in five clinics in South Africa. Pooled nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) was performed, followed by individual sample testing in positive pools. NAAT-positive participants were recalled to the clinics for confirmatory testing and appropriate management. HIV antibody, p24 antigen, Western Blot and avidity tests were performed for characterization of NAAT-positive samples.\n",
      "The study enrolled 6910 individuals with negative rapid HIV results. Median age was 27 years (interquartile range {IQR}: 23-31). NAAT was positive in 55 samples, resulting in 0.8% newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals (95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.6-1.0). The negative predictive value for rapid HIV testing was 99.2% (95% CI: 99.0-99.4). Characterization of NAAT-positive samples revealed that 0.04% (95% CI: 0.000-0.001) had AHI, 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4) had early HIV infection, and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.5-0.7) had chronic HIV infection. Forty-seven (86%) of NAAT-positive participants returned for follow-up at a median of 4 weeks (IQR: 2-8). Follow-up rapid tests were positive in 96% of these participants.\n",
      "NAAT demonstrated that a substantial number of HIV-infected individuals are misdiagnosed at South African points-of-care. Follow-up rapid tests done within a 4 week interval detected early and chronic HIV infections initially missed by rapid HIV testing. This may be a practical and affordable strategy for earlier detection of these infections in resource-constrained settings. Newer molecular tests that can be used at the points-of-care should be evaluated for routine diagnosis of HIV in hyper-endemic settings.\n",
      "Early HIV diagnosis and access to treatment is one of the most effective ways to prevent its further spread and to protect the health of those living with the virus. However, delay in diagnosis is the major risk factor for uptake of and response to antiretroviral therapy.\n",
      "Institution-based unmatched case-control study design was used in the study. The study was conducted in Debre-Markos and Finote-Selam Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. Cases were people living with HIV who had CD4 count <350cells/mm\n",
      "About 95.9 % of study participants provided complete response. Having no understanding, compared to having understanding, about HIV/AIDS (AOR = 1.7, 95 %CI = 1.08-2.79) and ART (AOR = 2.1, 95 %CI: 1.25-3.72), being tested as a result of symptoms/ illness, compared to being tested for risk exposure (inverted AOR =2.5, 95 %CI: 1.64-4.76), and acquiring HIV through sexual contact, compared to acquiring it through other modes (AOR = 2.5, 95 %CI = 1.52-4.76) were positively and independently associated with late HIV diagnosis.\n",
      "Unlike perceived HIV stigma, having no understanding about HIV and ART, being tested for presence of symptoms/illness, and acquiring HIV through sexual contact were independent and significant factors for late HIV diagnosis.\n",
      " In the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) study, immediate combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation reduced cancer risk by 64%. We hypothesized that risk reduction was higher for infection-related cancer and determined by differences in CD4 cell counts and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA between the study arms.\n",
      " Incident malignancies in START were categorized into infection-related and infection-unrelated cancer. We used Cox models to assess factors associated with both cancer categories. We used sequential adjustment for baseline covariates, cancer risk factors, and HIV-specific variables to investigate potential mediators of cancer risk reduction with immediate cART.\n",
      " There were 14 cancers among persons randomized to immediate cART (6 infection-related and 8 infection-unrelated) and 39 cancers in the deferred arm (23 infection-related and 16 infection-unrelated); hazard ratios of immediate vs deferred cART initiation were 0.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], .11-.64) for infection-related and 0.49 (95% CI, .21-1.15) for infection-unrelated cancer. Independent predictors of infection-related cancer were older age, higher body mass index, low- to middle-income region, HIV RNA, and baseline CD8 cell count. Older age and baseline CD8 cell count were independent predictors of infection-unrelated cancer. Adjustment for latest HIV RNA level had little impact on the protective effect of immediate cART on infection-related cancer. Adjustment for latest HIV RNA level, but not for CD4 cell count or cancer risk factors, attenuated the effect of immediate cART on infection-unrelated cancer.\n",
      " Immediate cART initiation significantly reduces risk of cancer. Although limited by small sample size, this benefit does not appear to be solely attributable to HIV RNA suppression and may be also mediated by other mechanisms.\n",

      "Cross-sectional, biomarker methods to determine HIV infection recency present a promising and cost-effective alternative to the repeated testing of uninfected individuals. We evaluate a viral-based assay that uses a measure of pairwise distances (PwD) to identify HIV infection recency, and compare its performance with two serologic incidence assays, BED and LAg. In addition, we assess whether combination BED plus PwD or LAg plus PwD screening can improve predictive accuracy by reducing the likelihood of a false-recent result.\n",
      "The data comes from 854 time-points and 42 participants enrolled in a primary HIV-1C infection study in Botswana. Time points after treatment initiation or with evidence of multiplicity of infection were excluded from the final analysis. PwD was calculated from quasispecies generated using single genome amplification and sequencing. We evaluated the ability of PwD to correctly classify HIV infection recency within <130, <180 and <360 days post-seroconversion using Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) methods. Following a secondary PwD screening, we quantified the reduction in the relative false-recency rate (rFRR) of the BED and LAg assays while maintaining a sensitivity of either 75, 80, 85 or 90%.\n",
      "The final analytic sample consisted of 758 time-points from 40 participants. The PwD assay was more accurate in classifying infection recency for the 130 and 180-day cut-offs when compared with the recommended LAg and BED thresholds. A higher AUC statistic confirmed the superior predictive performance of the PwD assay for the three cut-offs. When used for combination screening, the PwD assay reduced the rFRR of the LAg assay by 52% and the BED assay by 57.8% while maintaining a 90% sensitivity for the 130 and 180-day cut-offs respectively.\n",

      "Angola borders and has long-term links with Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as well as high levels of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) genetic diversity, indicating a potential role in the initial spread of the HIV-1 pandemic. Herein, we analyze 564 C2V3 and 354 pol publicly available sequences from DRC, Republic of Congo (RC) and Angola to better understand the initial spread of the virus in this region. Phylogeographic analyses were performed with the BEAST software. While our results pinpoint the origin of the pandemic to Kinshasa (DRC) around 1906, the introduction of HIV-1 to Angola could have occurred early between the 1910s and 1940s. Furthermore, most of the HIV-1 migrations out of Kinshasa were directed not only to Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi (DRC), but also to Luanda and Brazzaville. Kinshasa census records corroborate these findings, indicating that the early exportation of the virus to Angola might be related to the high number of Angolans in Kinshasa at that time, originated mostly from the North of Angola. In summary, our results place Angola at the epicenter of the early HIV dissemination, together with DRC and RC.\n",
      "Previous meta-analyses reported mortality estimates of 12-month post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation; however, 40%-60% of deaths occur in the first 3 months on ART, a more sensitive measure of averted deaths through early ART initiation. To determine whether early mortality is dropping as treatment thresholds have increased, we reviewed studies of 3 months on ART initiation in low- to middle-income countries. Studies of 3-month mortality from January 2003 to April 2016 were searched in 5 databases. Articles were included that reported 3-month mortality from a low- to middle-income country; nontrial setting and participants were ≥15. We assessed overall mortality and stratified by year using random effects models. Among 58 included studies, although not significant, pooled estimates show a decline in mortality when comparing studies whose enrollment of patients ended before 2010 (7.0%; 95% CI: 6.0 to 8.0) with the studies during or after 2010 (4.0%; 95% CI: 3.0 to 5.0). To continue to reduce early HIV-related mortality at the population level, intensified efforts to increase demand for ART through active testing and facilitated referral should be a priority. Continued financial investments by multinational partners and the implementation of creative interventions to mitigate multidimensional complex barriers of accessing care and treatment for HIV are needed.\n",
      "The loss of HIV-specific CD8+ T cell cytolytic function is a primary factor underlying progressive HIV infection, but whether HIV-specific CD8+ T cells initially possess cytolytic effector capacity, and when and why this may be lost during infection, is unclear. Here, we assessed CD8+ T cell functional evolution from primary to chronic HIV infection. We observed a profound expansion of perforin+ CD8+ T cells immediately following HIV infection that quickly waned after acute viremia resolution. Selective expression of the effector-associated transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin in cytokine-producing HIV-specific CD8+ T cells differentiated HIV-specific from bulk memory CD8+ T cell effector expansion. As infection progressed expression of perforin was maintained in HIV-specific CD8+ T cells with high levels of T-bet, but not necessarily in the population of T-betLo HIV-specific CD8+ T cells that expand as infection progresses. Together, these data demonstrate that while HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in acute HIV infection initially possess cytolytic potential, progressive transcriptional dysregulation leads to the reduced CD8+ T cell perforin expression characteristic of chronic HIV infection.\n",
      "Efforts to curb the spread of HIV transmission through transfusion of blood and its products is still a problem because of challenge in countries using antibody-based rapid methods to detect infection during window period. Transmission of HIV through infected blood and its products accounts for approximately 10% in African region.\n",
      "This study analyzed true negativity of HIV infection in blood donors screened by ELISA test based on p24 core antigen detection. Four hundred and eighty (480) blood donors initially negative for HIV antibody by rapid screening kit, Determine™ HIV-1/2 (Abbott Laboratory, IL, USA) and re-screened with Immuno Comb® II HIV 1 and 2 (Bispot kit PBS Organics and Israel 2005). The samples were further tested for the presence of HIV antibody and p24 HIV core antigen using ELISA kits (Genscreen TM ULTRA HIV Ag-Ab) following manufacturer's instructions. All donors initially tested negative for Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus.\n",
      "Two (0.42%) of 480 blood donors tested positive for the p24 HIV core antigen. The two positive donors for the p24 antigen had multiple sexual partners and recent sexually transmitted infections.\n",

      "Diagnostic guidelines for Tuberculosis (TB) in HIV infected patients previously relied on microscopy where the value of initial antibiotic treatment for exclusion of pulmonary TB (PTB) was limited. New guidelines rely on the Xpert MTB Rif test (Xpert). However, the value of the antibiotic treatment remains unclear particularly in individuals who are smear-negative and Xpert-negative-given Xpert has only moderate sensitivity for smear-negative PTB. We assessed an algorithm involving initial treatment with antibiotics prior empiric TB treatment in HIV patients with presumptive PTB who were both smear and Xpert negative.\n",
      "We performed a prospective study with six month follow-up to establish patient response to a course of broad spectrum antibiotics prior empiric TB treatment between March 2012 and June 2013. We calculated the proportion of patients who responded to the antibiotic treatment and those who did not. We computed the crude and adjusted odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals, for response to the antibiotic treatment on various patient characteristics. We report treatment outcomes for patients who received broad spectrum antibiotics only or who were initiated empiric TB treatment.\n",
      "Our cohort comprised 162 smear-negative and Xpert-negative patients, of whom 59% (96 of 162) were female, 81% (131 of 162) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for a median of 8.7 months. Overall, 88% (141 of 160) responded to the antibiotic treatment, 8% (12 of 160) got empiric TB treatment and 4% (7 out of 160) were treated for other respiratory disease. The odds of improvement on antibiotics were lower in patients with advanced HIV disease than in patients with early HIV disease. Adjusted odds ratios were significant for HIV clinical stage (AOR; 0.038,) and duration on ART (AOR; 1.038,).\n",
      "The majority of HIV patients with presumptive PTB with smear-negative and Xpert negative results improved on the antibiotic treatment and did not require empiric TB treatment. Initial antibiotic treatment appeared more successful in patients with less advanced HIV disease. Findings from our study suggest it is useful to initiate HIV infected patients with presumptive PTB having smear and Xpert negative results on an initial course of antibiotic treatment prior empiric TB treatment.\n",

      "We performed twice-weekly qualitative plasma HIV-1 RNA nucleic acid testing in 2276 volunteers who were at high risk for HIV-1 infection. For participants in whom acute HIV-1 infection was detected, clinical observations, quantitative measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (to assess viremia) and HIV antibodies, and results of immunophenotyping of lymphocytes were obtained twice weekly.\n",
      "Fifty of 112 volunteers with acute HIV-1 infection had two or more blood samples collected before HIV-1 antibodies were detected. The median peak viremia (6.7 log10 copies per milliliter) occurred 13 days after the first sample showed reactivity on nucleic acid testing. Reactivity on an enzyme immunoassay occurred at a median of 14 days. The nadir of viremia (4.3 log10 copies per milliliter) occurred at a median of 31 days and was nearly equivalent to the viral-load set point, the steady-state viremia that persists durably after resolution of acute viremia (median plasma HIV-1 RNA level, 4.4 log10 copies per milliliter). The peak viremia and downslope were correlated with the viral-load set point. Clinical manifestations of acute HIV-1 infection were most common just before and at the time of peak viremia. A median of one symptom of acute HIV-1 infection was recorded at a median of two study visits, and a median of one sign of acute HIV-1 infection was recorded at a median of three visits.\n",

      "The trial included HIV-infected infants who initiated ART at less than 13 months of age, received ART for 24 months, and, if eligible (CD4% >25%, normal growth), were randomized to treatment interruption versus continued ART. Children in the treatment interruption group restarted ART if they met WHO ART-eligibility criteria. During 18-months postrandomization, primary outcomes were incidence of serious adverse events and growth. CD4%, viral load, morbidity, and growth were compared.\n",
      "Of 140 infants enrolled, 121 started ART, of whom 75 completed at least 24 months ART and 42 were randomized (21 per arm). ART was initiated at median age 5 months and randomization at 30 months. Among 21 treatment interruption children, 14 met ART restart criteria within 3 months. Randomization was discontinued by Data and Safety Monitoring Board due to low treatment interruption durability. At 18 months postrandomization, growth and serious adverse events were comparable between arms; hypercholesteremia incidence was higher in the continued arm (P = 0.03). CD4% and viral load did not differ between arms [CD4% 35% and median viral load undetectable (<150 copies/ml) in both arms, P = 0.9 for each comparison]. No infants had post-treatment viral control.\n",

      "Little is known about the incidence and risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+) among migrants living with HIV in a European setting. We assessed the cumulative incidence (CuI) and hazard ratio (HR) of CIN2+ and CIN3+ in a cohort of women living with HIV (WLWH) (n = 893) identified from the Swedish national HIV register and HIV-negative women (n = 205,842) identified from the Swedish Population Register, matched on region of birth and age. Data was collected between 1993 and 2011 by linking our cohort with the Swedish National Cervical Screening Registry, collecting all cytological and histological results since 1993. The CuI of CIN3+ was 13.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.9-17.2] for WLWH and 2.1% (95% CI 2.0-2.2) for HIV-negative after 18 years of follow-up. WLWH had more than eight times higher, age and region of birth matched, risk of CIN3+ than HIV-negative (HR 8.8: 95% CI 6.9-11.3). WLWH born in the East region, dominated by Thai women, had a two times higher risk of CIN3+ compared with WLWH born in Sweden (HR 2.47: 95% CI 1.2-5.0), which remained after adjusting for immunosuppression. Our results showed a substantially increased risk of CIN3+ among WLWH, which differed depending on birth region. Early HIV diagnosis and attendance to cervical cancer screening, with focus on migrants, is of crucial importance to minimize the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\n",
      "We report two cases of HIV infection among female travellers of older age. A Danish woman in her eighties was diagnosed with acute HIV infection after travelling to West Africa. A sexual history was not recorded before her third hospital visit. A West African woman in her seventies who had been living in Denmark for 40 years was diagnosed with advanced HIV after having been to West Africa for family visits. We want to emphasize that women of older age also have sex that may put them at risk of HIV, that febrile returning travellers should be tested for HIV, and that presence of HIV indicator diseases should lead to HIV testing.\n",
      "Following HIV-1 acquisition, many individuals develop an acute retroviral syndrome and a majority seek care. Available antibody testing cannot detect an acute HIV infection, but repeat testing after 2-4 weeks may detect seroconversion. We assessed the effect of appointment reminders on attendance for repeat HIV testing.\n",
      "We enrolled, in a randomized controlled trial, 18-29 year old patients evaluated for acute HIV infection at five sites in Coastal Kenya (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01876199). Participants were allocated 1:1 to either standard appointment (a dated appointment card) or enhanced appointment (a dated appointment card plus SMS and phone call reminders, or in-person reminders for participants without a phone). The primary outcome was visit attendance, i.e., the proportion of participants attending the repeat test visit. Factors associated with attendance were examined by bivariable and multivariable logistic regression.\n",
      "Between April and July 2013, 410 participants were randomized. Attendance was 41% (85/207) for the standard group and 59% (117/199) for the enhanced group, for a relative risk of 1.4 [95% Confidence Interval, CI, 1.2-1.7].Higher attendance was independently associated with older age, study site, and report of transactional sex in past month. Lower attendance was associated with reporting multiple partners in the past two months.\n",
      "Appointment reminders through SMS, phone calls and in-person reminders increased the uptake of repeat HIV test by forty percent. This low-cost intervention could facilitate detection of acute HIV infections and uptake of recommended repeat testing.\n",

      "Total CD4 T-cell counts predict HIV disease progression but do not necessarily reflect normalization of immune function. CD4/CD8 ratio is a marker of immune dysfunction, a prognostic indicator for non-AIDS mortality, and reflects viral reservoir size. Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), recovery of CD4/CD8 ratio in chronic HIV infection is incomplete; we hypothesize enhanced CD4/CD8 ratio recovery with earlier treatment initiation in recently infected individuals.\n",
      "CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio were analyzed using data from 2 cohorts: SPARTAC trial and the UK HIV Seroconverters Cohort where primary HIV infection (PHI) was defined as within 6 months from estimated date of infection. Using time-to-event methods and Cox proportional hazard models, we examined the effect of CD4/CD8 ratio at seroconversion on disease progression (CD4 <350 cells per cubic millimeter/ART initiation) and factors associated with time from ART initiation to CD4/CD8 normalization (ratio >1.0).\n",
      "Of 573 seroconverters, 482 (84%) had abnormal CD4/CD8 ratios at HIV seroconversion. Individuals with higher CD4/CD8 ratio at seroconversion were significantly less likely to reach the disease progression endpoint [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.32 to 0.82), P = 0.005]. The longer the interval between seroconversion and ART initiation [HR (95% CI) = 0.98 per month increase (0.97, 0.99), P < 0.001], the less likely the CD4/CD8 ratio normalization. ART initiation within 6 months from seroconversion was significantly more likely to normalize [HR (95% CI) = 2.47 (1.67 to 3.67), P < 0.001] than those initiating later.\n",
      "Most individuals presenting in PHI have abnormal CD4/CD8 ratios. The sooner the ART is initiated in PHI, the greater the probability of achieving normal CD4/CD8 ratio.\n",
      "The acute phase of HIV infection carries substantial risk of transmission; identification of acute-phase infections may offer opportunities to reduce that risk. SMARTube incubation of blood specimens is designed to stimulate in vivo-primed HIV-specific lymphocytes to produce HIV antibodies in vitro. The resulting supernatant (S-plasma) can be tested to identify acute infections with commercially available HIV assays. We assessed the performance of the SMARTube to identify acute HIV infections in studies at three developing country sites. We conducted HIV incidence studies in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Bloemfontein and Rustenburg, South Africa. We estimated HIV incidence in cross-sectional samples and measured prospective incidence in uninfected women followed for up to 12 months. We incorporated SMARTube into the HIV testing algorithm at cross-sectional screening and monthly follow-up visits. We tested 1,384 persons in Vietnam, 1,145 women in Bloemfontein, and 538 persons in Rustenburg. Cross-sectional samples from 11 participants that tested positive with SMARTube after an initial unincubated negative test result (11 of 2,472; 0.4% of all specimens) were considered \"potential acute\" infections. Matching samples from 3 of the 11 (27.3%) were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. In follow-up of 355, 401, and 223 uninfected women in Vietnam, Bloemfontein, and Rustenburg, respectively, 11 seroconversions occurred in Bloemfontein and Rustenburg. In four of these incident infections (36.4%), SMARTube testing had resulted in earlier detection of HIV infection than the eventual seroconversion visits. In our field studies, pretreatment with SMARTube allowed the identification of acute HIV-1 infection in some new infections, but with a positive predictive value of 27%. Larger studies are needed to evaluate SMARTube as an alternative to technically challenging and costly enzyme immunoassay and PCR testing to detect acute HIV infection.\n",
      "Could we have predicted national peak HIV based on syphilis prevalence in the 1990s? Earlier studies have shown positive correlations between various sexually transmitted infections at different population levels. In this article, we test the hypothesis that there was a residual variation in the national prevalence rates of syphilis and that these rates could predict subsequent peak HIV prevalence rates.\n",
      "This analysis uses linear regression to evaluate the country-level relationship between antenatal syphilis prevalence (1990-1999) and peak HIV prevalence. Antenatal syphilis data were taken from an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation database on the prevalence of syphilis in low-risk populations. Peak HIV prevalence was calculated based on data taken from the Global Health Observatory Data Repository of the World Health Organization.\n",
      "A moderately strong association is found for the 76 countries with data available (R = 0.53, P < 0.001). The association was weakened but remained significantly positive when we adjusted for the type of syphilis testing used.\n",
      "Syphilis prevalence in the 1990s predicted approximately 53% of the variation in peak HIV prevalence. Populations with generalized HIV epidemics had a higher prevalence of syphilis in the pre-HIV period. This finding provides additional rationale to carefully monitor sexual behavior, sexual networks, and sexually transmitted infection incidence in these populations.\n",
      "Infants and children living with HIV receive antiretroviral treatment often late, are exposed to opportunistic infection and quickly develop AIDS. Few hospitals are providing ART service after Dried Blood Spot (DBS)test.The objective of this study is to assess the status of infants and children linked to ART.\n",
      "Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in hospitals. Data of 138 infants and children exposed to HIV were collected from registration books and data bases from 2009 to 2011. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Chi-squared test and p-value were computed. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants.\n",
      "Ninety-eight (71%) infants and children exposed to HIV were diagnosed for HIV infection of which 68(69.4%) initiated ART. Twenty four (35.3%) initiated ART one month after HIV screening results. Thirty-three (50.0%) and 23(35.3%) infants and children dropped from and adhered to ART respectively. Eleven (16.2%) of them who initiated ART died within the study period. HIV infection status (p-value=0.003), dropping from ART (p-value=0.002) and death after ART initiation (p-value=0.010) showed significance with mothers' PMTCT service status.\n",
      "Seven in ten HIV-exposed infants and children were diagnosed with HIV, and almost all of them initiated ART. The overall turnaround time was 10 days. Based up on mothers' PMTCT service status, there was a significant difference among HIV-exposed infants and children in acquiring HIV infection from mothers during pregnancy (p-value=0.003) and dropping from ART (p-value=0.010). There were challenges in sample collection and transportation. Early HIV screening during pregnancy and PMTCT service should be strengthened.\n",
      "Little is known on the risk of cancer in HIV-positive children in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined incidence and risk factors of AIDS-defining and other cancers in pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in South Africa.\n",
      "We linked the records of 5 ART programs in Johannesburg and Cape Town to those of pediatric oncology units, based on name and surname, date of birth, folder and civil identification numbers. We calculated incidence rates and obtained hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from Cox regression models including ART, sex, age and degree of immunodeficiency. Missing CD4 counts and CD4% were multiply imputed. Immunodeficiency was defined according to World Health Organization 2005 criteria.\n",
      "Data of 11,707 HIV-positive children were included in the analysis. During 29,348 person-years of follow-up 24 cancers were diagnosed, for an incidence rate of 82 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 55-122). The most frequent cancers were Kaposi sarcoma (34 per 100,000 person-years) and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (31 per 100,000 person-years). The incidence of non AIDS-defining malignancies was 17 per 100,000. The risk of developing cancer was lower on ART (HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.86), and increased with age at enrollment (>10 vs. <3 years: HR: 7.3; 95% CI: 2.2-24.6) and immunodeficiency at enrollment (advanced/severe versus no/mild: HR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.1-12.0).

      "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play a central role in the response to infection by secreting cytokines crucial for immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and repair. Although dysregulation of these systems is central to pathology, the impact of HIV-1 on ILCs remains unknown. We found that human blood ILCs were severely depleted during acute viremic HIV-1 infection and that ILC numbers did not recover after resolution of peak viremia. ILC numbers were preserved by antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only if initiated during acute infection. Transcriptional profiling during the acute phase revealed upregulation of genes associated with cell death, temporally linked with a strong IFN acute-phase response and evidence of gut barrier breakdown. We found no evidence of tissue redistribution in chronic disease and remaining circulating ILCs were activated but not apoptotic. These data provide a potential mechanistic link between acute HIV-1 infection, lymphoid tissue breakdown, and persistent immune dysfunction.\n",
      "Attrition within the CD4(+)T cell compartment, high viremia, and a cytokine storm characterize the early days after HIV infection. When the first emerging HIV-specific CD8(+)T cell responses gain control over viral replication it is incomplete, and clearance of HIV infection is not achieved even in the rare cases of individuals who spontaneously control viral replication to nearly immeasurably low levels. Thus, despite their partial ability to control viremia, HIV-specific CD8(+)T cell responses are insufficient to clear HIV infection. Studying individuals in the first few days of acute HIV infection, we detected the emergence of a unique population of CD38(+)CD27(-)CD8(+)T cells characterized by the low expression of the CD8 receptor (CD8(dim)). Interestingly, while high frequencies of HIV-specific CD8(+)T cell responses occur within the CD38(+)CD27(-)CD8(dim)T cell population, the minority populations of CD8(bright)T cells are significantly more effective in inhibiting HIV replication. Furthermore, the frequency of CD8(dim)T cells directly correlates with viral load and clinical predictors of more rapid disease progression. We found that a canonical burst of proliferative cytokines coincides with the emergence of CD8(dim)T cells, and the size of this population inversely correlates with the acute loss of CD4(+)T cells. These data indicate, for the first time, that early CD4(+)T cell loss coincides with the expansion of a functionally impaired HIV-specific CD8(dim)T cell population less efficient in controlling HIV viremia.\n",
      "A distinct population of activated CD8(+)T cells appears during acute HIV infection with diminished capacity to inhibit HIV replication and is predictive of viral set point, offering the first immunologic evidence of CD8(+)T cell dysfunction during acute infection.\n",
      "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting conserved epitopes on the HIV envelope glycoprotein have been identified in blood from HIV-1 infected women. We investigated whether antibodies in the genital tract from these women share similar epitope specificities and functional profiles as those in blood.\n",
      "Immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA antibodies were isolated from cervicovaginal lavages or Softcups from 13 HIV-infected women in the CAPRISA cohort using Protein G and Peptide M, respectively. Binding antibodies to envelope antigens were quantified by ELISA and binding antibody multiplex assay. Neutralizing antibody titers and epitope targets were measured using the TZM-bl assay with Env-pseudotyped wild-type and mutated viruses.\n",
      "HIV-specific IgG, but not IgA, was detected in genital secretions and the ratio of total IgG to HIV-specific IgG was similar to plasma. HIV-specific IgG reacted with multiple envelope antigens, including V1V2, gp120, gp140 and gp41. Two women had high plasma titers of HIV-specific IgG3 which was also detected in their genital tract samples. IgG from the genital tract had neutralizing activity against both Tier 1 and Tier 2 primary HIV-isolates. Antibodies targeting well known glycan epitopes and the membrane proximal region of gp41 were detected in genital secretions, and matched specificities in plasma.\n",
      "Women with plasma bNAbs have overlapping specificities in their genital secretions, indicating that these predominantly IgG isotype antibodies may transudate from blood to the genital tract. These data provide evidence that induction of systemic HIV-specific bNAbs can lead to antiviral immunity at the portal of entry.\n",
      "Various models for estimating the residual risk (RR) of transmission of infections by blood transfusion have been published mainly based on data from high-income countries. However, to obtain the data required for such an assessment remains challenging for most developing settings. The National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ) adapted a published incidence-window period (IWP) model, which has less demanding data requirements. In this study we assess the impact of various definitions of blood donor subpopulations and models on RR estimates. We compared the outcomes of two published models and an adapted NBSZ model.\n",
      "The Schreiber IWP model (Model 1), an amended version (Model 2), and an adapted NBSZ model (Model 3) were applied. Variably the three models include prevalence, incidence, preseroconversion intervals, mean lifetime risk, and person-years at risk. Annual mean RR estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each of the three models for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were determined using NBSZ blood donor data from 2002 through 2011.\n",
      "The annual mean RR estimates for Models 1 through 3 were 1 in 6542, 5805, and 6418, respectively for HIV; 1 in 1978, 2027, and 1628 for HBV; and 1 in 9588, 15,126, and 7750, for HCV.\n",
      "The adapted NBSZ model provided comparable results to the published methods and these highlight the high occurrence of HBV in Zimbabwe. The adapted NBSZ model could be used as an alternative to estimate RRs when in settings where two repeat donations are not available.\n",
      "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are thought to be a critical component of a protective HIV vaccine. However, designing vaccines immunogens able to elicit bnAbs has proven unsuccessful to date. Understanding the correlates and immunological mechanisms leading to the development of bnAb responses during natural HIV infection is thus critical to the design of a protective vaccine. The IAVI Protocol C program investigates a large longitudinal cohort of primary HIV-1 infection in Eastern and South Africa. Development of neutralization was evaluated in 439 donors using a 6 cross-clade pseudo-virus panel predictive of neutralization breadth on larger panels. About 15% of individuals developed bnAb responses, essentially between year 2 and year 4 of infection. Statistical analyses revealed no influence of gender, age or geographical origin on the development of neutralization breadth. However, cross-clade neutralization strongly correlated with high viral load as well as with low CD4 T cell counts, subtype-C infection and HLA-A*03(-) genotype. A correlation with high overall plasma IgG levels and anti-Env IgG binding titers was also found. The latter appeared not associated with higher affinity, suggesting a greater diversity of the anti-Env responses in broad neutralizers. Broadly neutralizing activity targeting glycan-dependent epitopes, largely the N332-glycan epitope region, was detected in nearly half of the broad neutralizers while CD4bs and gp41-MPER bnAb responses were only detected in very few individuals. Together the findings suggest that both viral and host factors are critical for the development of bnAbs and that the HIV Env N332-glycan supersite may be a favorable target for vaccine design.\n",
      "Resistance to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or TDF alone used as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been detected in individuals who initiated PrEP during unrecognized acute HIV infection and, rarely, in PrEP breakthrough infections. PrEP-selected resistance could alter future treatment options, and therefore we sought to determine how long resistance persisted after PrEP cessation.\n",
      "The Partners PrEP Study was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of FTC/TDF or TDF as PrEP for HIV prevention. We previously reported that PrEP-related mutations (K65R, K70E or M184IV) were detected by 454 sequencing following seroconversion in nine individuals who acquired HIV during the Partners PrEP Study. In the current study, we used 454 sequencing to detect and quantify PrEP-related mutations in HIV RNA-positive plasma samples prior to seroconversion, as well as in plasma from 6, 12, and 24 months after PrEP cessation from these nine individuals.\n",
      "HIV RNA-positive, antibody-negative samples were available prior to seroconversion for four of nine individuals with resistance detected at seroconversion. In all four cases, K65R, K70E and M184IV were not detected prior to seroconversion, suggesting PrEP-related resistance was selected and not transmitted. All PrEP-selected mutations were no longer detectable by 6 months after PrEP cessation and remained undetectable at 12 and 24 months in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.\n",
      "Using highly sensitive assays, PrEP-selected resistance in plasma decays below detection by 6 months following drug cessation and remains undetectable for at least 24 months. Even high levels of resistance mutations during acute infection decay rapidly in the absence of ongoing PrEP exposure.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of medical screening to retain blood donors in window period by comparing the seroprevalence of infectious agents (HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis) in deferred versus accepted blood donors.\n",
      "This prospective and transversal study was performed during 4 months in the National Blood Transfusion Center in Dakar (Senegal). We conducted a convenience sampling comparing the seroprevalence of infectious agents (HIV, HBsAg, HCV and syphilis) in deferred versus accepted blood donors after medical selection.\n",
      "In total, 8219 blood donors were included. Medical selection had authorized 8048 donors (97.92%) and deferred donors were 171 (2.08%). The prevalence of HIV was higher in the deferred than in accepted blood donors (1.75% vs. 0.05%) (P=0.0003; OR=35.91), as well as for HBsAg (12.87% vs. 7.35%) (P=0.006; OR=1.86). HCV antibodies were present in 0.71% of accepted blood donors and 0.58% in deferred blood donors (P=0.65; OR=0.82). Only accepted donors had brought the infection of syphilis (0.34%) (P=0.56; OR=0).\n",
      "Medical selection is efficient to exclude blood donors at high risk of HIV transmission and to a lesser extent of HBV. However, current medical screening procedures do not allow us to exclude donors asymptomatic carriers of HCV and syphilis.\n",
      "Patients with acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) have elevated infectivity, but cannot be diagnosed using antibody-based testing. Approaches to screen patients for AHI are urgently needed to enable counselling and treatment to reduce onward transmission.\n",
      "We pooled data from four African studies of high-risk adults that evaluated symptoms and signs compatible with acute retroviral syndrome and tested for HIV-1 at each visit. AHI was defined as detectable plasma viral load or p24 antigen in an HIV-1-antibody-negative patient who subsequently seroconverted. Using generalized estimating equation, we identified symptoms, signs, and demographic factors predictive of AHI, adjusting for study site. We assigned a predictor score to each statistically significant predictor based on its beta coefficient, summing predictor scores to calculate a risk score for each participant. We evaluated the performance of this algorithm overall and at each site.\n",
      "We compared 122 AHI visits with 45 961 visits by uninfected patients. Younger age (18-29 years), fever, fatigue, body pains, diarrhoea, sore throat, and genital ulcer disease were independent predictors of AHI. The overall area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for the algorithm was 0.78, with site-specific AUCs ranging from 0.61 to 0.89. A risk score of at least 2 would indicate AHI testing for 5-50% of participants, substantially decreasing the number needing testing.\n",
      "Our targeted risk score algorithm based on seven characteristics reduced the number of patients needing AHI testing and had good performance overall. We recommend this risk score algorithm for use by HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa with capacity to test high-risk patients for AHI.\n",
      "Fourth-generation HIV-1 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect HIV-1 p24 antigen to screen for acute HIV-1. However, diagnostic accuracy during clinical use may be suboptimal.\n",

      "Four studies with 17 381 participants from Australia, Swaziland, the United Kingdom and Malawi were identified. All reported 0% sensitivity of the HIV-1 p24 component for acute HIV-1 diagnosis; 26 acute infections were missed. Specificity ranged from 98.3 to 99.9%.\n",

      "Cells from women who are epidemiologically deemed resistant to HIV infection exhibit a 40-60% reduction in endogenous IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor-1), an essential regulator of host antiviral immunity and the early HIV replication. This study examined the functional consequences of reducing endogenous IRF-1 on HIV-1 replication and immune response to HIV in natural HIV target cells. IRF-1 knockdown was achieved in ex vivo CD4(+) T cells and monocytes with siRNA. IRF-1 level was assessed using flow cytometry, prior to infection with HIV-Bal, HIV-IIIB, or HIV-VSV-G. Transactivation of HIV long terminal repeats was assessed by p24 secretion (ELISA) and Gag expression (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)). The expression of IRF-1-regulated antiviral genes was quantitated with RT-PCR. A modest 20-40% reduction in endogenous IRF-1 was achieved in >87% of ex vivo-derived peripheral CD4(+) T cells and monocytes, resulted in >90% reduction in the transactivation of the HIV-1 genes (Gag, p24) and, hence, HIV replication. Curiously, these HIV-resistant women demonstrated normal immune responses, nor an increased susceptibility to other infection. Similarly, modest IRF-1 knockdown had limited impact on the magnitude of HIV-1-elicited activation of IRF-1-regulated host immunologic genes but resulted in lessened duration of these responses. These data suggest that early expression of HIV-1 genes requires a higher IRF-1 level, compared to the host antiviral genes. Together, these provide one key mechanism underlying the natural resistance against HIV infection and further suggest that modest IRF-1 reduction could effectively limit productive HIV infection yet remain sufficient to activate a robust but transient immune response.\n",
      "Retention to HIV care is vital for patients' survival, to prevent onward transmission and emergence of drug resistance. Travelling to receive care might influence adherence. Data on the functioning of and retention to HIV care in the Central African region are limited.\n",
      "This retrospective study reports outcomes and factors associated with retention to HIV care at a primary HIV clinic in Lambaréné, Gabon. Adult patients who presented to this clinic between January 2010 and January 2012 were included. Outcomes were retention in care (defined as documented show-up for clinical visits, regardless of delay) or LTFU (defined as a patient not retained in care; on ART or ART naïve, not returning to care during the study period with a patient delay for scheduled visits of more than 6 months), and mortality. Cox regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with respective outcomes. Qualitative data on reasons for LTFU were obtained from focus-group discussions.\n",
      "Of 223 patients included, 67.3% were female. The mean age was 40.5 (standard deviation 11.4) years and the median CD4 count 275 (interquartile range 100.5-449.5) cells/μL. In total, 34.1% were lost to follow up and 8.1% died. Documented tuberculosis was associated with increased risk of being LTFU (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.05-3.11, P = 0.03), whereas early starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a decreased risk of LTFU (aHR 0.43, 95%CI 0.24-0.76, P = 0.004), as was confirmed by qualitative data.\n",
      "Retention to HIV care in a primary clinic in Gabon is relatively poor and interventions to address this should be prioritized in the HIV program. Early initiation of ART might improve retention in care.\n",

      "Subjects who hold a certificate and above (AOR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.13. 0.54), being initiated by friends, families and other socials to undertake HIV testing (AOR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.29, 1.48), who reported a medium and high knowledge score about HIV/AIDS and who undertake HIV testing while visiting a clinic for ANC (AOR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.83) were less likely to be diagnosed late. Subjects who undertake HIV testing due to providers' initiation (AOR = 1.70; 95%CI = 1.08, 2.68), who reported a medium internalized stigma (AOR = 4.94; 95% CI = 3.13, 7.80) and who reported a high internalized stigma score towards HIV/AIDS (AOR = 16.64; 95% CI = 8.29, 33.4) had a high odds of being diagnosed late compared to their counterparts.\n",
      "Internalized stigma, low knowledge level about HIV/AIDS, not to have attended formal education and failure to undertake HIV testing by own initiation were significant determinant factors associated with Late HIV diagnosis. Education about HIV/AIDS, promotion of general education, and encouraging people to motivate their social mates to undertake HIV testing are highly recommended.\n",
      "CCR5-using (r5) HIV-1 predominates during asymptomatic disease followed by occasional emergence of CXCR4-using (x4) or dual tropic (r5x4) virus. We examined the contribution of the x4 and r5 components to replicative fitness of HIV-1 isolates.\n",
      "Dual tropic r5x4 viruses were predicted from average HIV-1 env sequences of two primary subtype C HIV-1 isolates (C19 and C27) and from two patient plasma samples (B12 and B19). Chimeric Env viruses with an NL4-3 backbone were constructed from the B12 and B19 env sequences. To determine replicative fitness, these primary and chimeric dual tropic HIV-1 were then competed against HIV-1 reference isolates in U87.CD4 cells expressing CXCR4 or CCR5 or in PBMCs ± entry inhibitors. Contribution of the x4 and r5 clones within the quasispecies of these chimeric or primary HIV-1 isolates were then compared to the frequency of x4, r5, and dual tropic clones within the quasispecies as predicted by phenotypic assays, clonal sequencing, and 454 deep sequencing.\n",
      "In the primary HIV-1 isolates (C19 and C27), subtype C dual tropic clones dominated over x4 clones while pure r5 clones were absent. In two subtype B chimeric viruses (B12 and B19), r5 clones were >100-fold more abundant than x4 or r5/x4 clones. The dual tropic C19 and C27 HIV-1 isolates outcompeted r5 primary HIV-1 isolates, B2 and C3 in PBMCs. When AMD3100 was added or when only U87.CD4.CCR5 cells were used, the B2 and C3 reference viruses now out-competed the r5 component of the dual tropic C19 and C27. In contrast, the same replicative fitness was observed with dualtropic B12 and B19 HIV-1 isolates relative to x4 HIV-1 A8 and E6 or the r5 B2 and C3 viruses, even when the r5 or x4 component was inhibited by maraviroc (or AMD3100) or in U87.CD4.CXCR4 (or CCR5) cells.\n",
      "In the dual tropic HIV-1 isolates, the x4 replicative fitness is higher than r5 clones but the x4 or x4/r5 clones are typically at low frequency in the intrapatient virus population. Ex vivo HIV propagation promotes outgrowth of the x4 clones and provides an over-estimate of x4 dominance in replicative fitness within dual tropic viruses.\n",
      "Integrating acute HIV-infection (AHI) testing into clinical settings is critical to prevent transmission, and realize potential treatment-as-prevention benefits. We evaluated acceptability of AHI testing and compared AHI prevalence at sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics and HIV testing and counseling (HTC) clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi.\n",
      "We conducted HIV RNA testing for HIV-seronegative patients visiting STI and HTC clinics. AHI was defined as positive RNA and negative/discordant rapid antibody tests. We evaluated demographic, behavioral, and transmission-risk differences between STI and HTC patients and assessed performance of a risk-score for targeted screening.\n",
      "Nearly two-thirds (62.8%, 9280/14,755) of eligible patients consented to AHI testing. We identified 59 persons with AHI (prevalence = 0.64%)-a 0.9% case-identification increase. Prevalence was higher at STI [1.03% (44/4255)] than at HTC clinics [0.3% (15/5025), P < 0.01], accounting for 2.3% of new diagnoses vs 0.3% at HTC clinic. Median viral load (VL) was 758,050 copies per milliliter; 25% (15/59) had VL ≥ 10,000,000 copies per milliliter. Median VL was higher at STI (1,000,000 copies/mL) compared with HTC (153,125 copies/mL, P = 0.2). Among persons with AHI, those tested at STI clinics were more likely to report genital sores compared with those tested at HTC clinics (54.6% vs 6.7%, P < 0.01). The risk score algorithm performed well in identifying persons with AHI at HTC clinics (sensitivity = 73%, specificity = 89%).\n",
      "The majority of patients consented to AHI testing. AHI prevalence was substantially higher in STI clinics than HTC clinics. Remarkably high VLs and concomitant genital scores demonstrate the potential for transmission. Universal AHI screening at STI clinics, and targeted screening at HTC centers, should be considered.\n",
      "Home-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high uptake, but is difficult and expensive to implement and sustain. We investigated a novel alternative based on HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim was to evaluate the uptake of testing, accuracy, linkage into care, and health outcomes when highly convenient and flexible but supported access to HIVST kits was provided to a well-defined and closely monitored population.\n",
      "Following enumeration of 14 neighbourhoods in urban Blantyre, Malawi, trained resident volunteer-counsellors offered oral HIVST kits (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test) to adult (≥16 y old) residents (n = 16,660) and reported community events, with all deaths investigated by verbal autopsy. Written and demonstrated instructions, pre- and post-test counselling, and facilitated HIV care assessment were provided, with a request to return kits and a self-completed questionnaire. Accuracy, residency, and a study-imposed requirement to limit HIVST to one test per year were monitored by home visits in a systematic quality assurance (QA) sample. Overall, 14,004 (crude uptake 83.8%, revised to 76.5% to account for population turnover) residents self-tested during months 1-12, with adolescents (16-19 y) most likely to test. 10,614/14,004 (75.8%) participants shared results with volunteer-counsellors. Of 1,257 (11.8%) HIV-positive participants, 26.0% were already on antiretroviral therapy, and 524 (linkage 56.3%) newly accessed care with a median CD4 count of 250 cells/μl (interquartile range 159-426). HIVST uptake in months 13-24 was more rapid (70.9% uptake by 6 mo), with fewer (7.3%, 95% CI 6.8%-7.8%) positive participants. Being \"forced to test\", usually by a main partner, was reported by 2.9% (95% CI 2.6%-3.2%) of 10,017 questionnaire respondents in months 1-12, but satisfaction with HIVST (94.4%) remained high. No HIVST-related partner violence or suicides were reported. HIVST and repeat HTC results agreed in 1,639/1,649 systematically selected (1 in 20) QA participants (99.4%), giving a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% CI 88.2%-97.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.6%-100%). Key limitations included use of aggregate data to report uptake of HIVST and being unable to adjust for population turnover.\n",
      "Community-based HIVST achieved high coverage in two successive years and was safe, accurate, and acceptable. Proactive HIVST strategies, supported and monitored by communities, could substantially complement existing approaches to providing early HIV diagnosis and periodic repeat testing to adolescents and adults in high-HIV settings.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection includes acute, early, chronic, and late stages. Acute HIV infection lasts approximately 3 weeks and early HIV infection, which includes acute HIV infection, lasts approximately 7 weeks. Many testing and blood screening algorithms detect HIV antibodies about 3 weeks after HIV infection. Incidence estimates are based on results of modeling, cohort studies, surveillance, and/or assays. Viral load is the key modifiable risk factor for HIV transmission and peaks during acute and early HIV infection. Empirical evidence characterizing the impact of acute and early HIV infection on the spread of the HIV epidemic are limited. Time trends of HIV prevalence collected from concentrated and generalized epidemics suggest that acute and early HIV infection may have a limited role in population HIV transmission. Collectively, these data suggest that acute and early HIV infection is relatively short and does not currently require fundamentally different programmatic approaches to manage the HIV/AIDS epidemic in most settings. Research and surveillance will inform which epidemic contexts and phases may require tailored strategies for these stages of HIV infection.\n",
      "Antiretroviral therapy, antibody and CD8+ T cell-mediated responses targeting human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) exert selection pressure on the virus necessitating escape; however, the ability of CD4+ T cells to exert selective pressure remains unclear. Using a computational approach on HIV gag/pol/nef sequences and HLA-II allelic data, we identified 29 HLA-II associated HIV sequence polymorphisms or adaptations (HLA-AP) in an African cohort of chronically HIV-infected individuals. Epitopes encompassing the predicted adaptation (AE) or its non-adapted (NAE) version were evaluated for immunogenicity. Using a CD8-depleted IFN-γ ELISpot assay, we determined that the magnitude of CD4+ T cell responses to the predicted epitopes in controllers was higher compared to non-controllers (p<0.0001). However, regardless of the group, the magnitude of responses to AE was lower as compared to NAE (p<0.0001). CD4+ T cell responses in patients with acute HIV infection (AHI) demonstrated poor immunogenicity towards AE as compared to NAE encoded by their transmitted founder virus. Longitudinal data in AHI off antiretroviral therapy demonstrated sequence changes that were biologically confirmed to represent CD4+ escape mutations. These data demonstrate an innovative application of HLA-associated polymorphisms to identify biologically relevant CD4+ epitopes and suggests CD4+ T cells are active participants in driving HIV evolution.\n",
      "Understanding contributors to mortality during the initial phase of tuberculosis (TB) treatment in patients co-infected with HIV would guide targeted interventions to improve survival. The aim of this study was to ascertain the incidence of death during the initial 2 months (new cases) and 3 months (retreatment cases) of TB treatment and to assess correlates of mortality in HIV co-infected patients.\n",
      "We conducted a hospital-based retrospective cohort study from January 2006 to December 2013 at Yaoundé Central Hospital, Cameroon. We reviewed medical records to identify co-infected TB/HIV inpatients aged 15 years and older who died during TB treatment. Death was defined as any death occurring during TB treatment, as per World Health Organization recommendations. We collected socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory data. We conducted multivariable logistic binary regression analysis to identify factors associated with death during the intensive phase of TB treatment. Magnitudes of associations were expressed by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "The 99 patients enrolled had a mean age of 39.5 (standard deviation 10.9) years and 53% were male. Patients were followed for 276.3 person-months of observation (PMO). Forty nine patients were died during intensive phase of TB treatment. Death incidence during the intensive phase of TB treatment was 32.2 per 100 PMO. Having a non-AIDS comorbidity (aOR 2.47, 95%CI 1.22-5.02, p = 0.012), having extra-pulmonary TB (aOR 1.89, 95%CI 1.05-3.43, p = 0.035), and one year increase in duration of known HIV infection (aOR 1.23, 95%CI 1.004-1.49) were independently associated with death during the intensive phase of TB treatment.\n",
      "Mortality incidence during intensive phase of TB treatment was high among TB/HIV co-infected patients during TB treatment; and strongly associated with extra pulmonary TB suggesting advanced stage of immunosuppression and non-AIDS comorbidities. Early HIV diagnosis and care and good management of non-comorbidities can reduce this incidence.\n",
      "Optimizing methods for genital specimen collection to accurately characterize mucosal immune responses is a priority for the HIV prevention field. The menstrual cup (MC) has been proposed as an alternative to other methods including cervicovaginal lavage (CVL), but no study has yet formally compared these two methods.\n",
      "Forty HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve women from the CAPRISA 002 acute HIV infection cohort study were randomized to have genital fluid collected using the MC with subsequent CVL, or by CVL alone. Qualitative data, which assessed levels of comfort and acceptability of MC using a 5-point Likert scale, was collected. Luminex multiplex assays were used to measure HIV-specific IgG against multiple gene products and 48 cytokines.\n",
      "The majority (94%) of participants indicated that insertion, wearing and removal of the MC was comfortable. Nineteen MCs with 18 matching, subsequent CVLs and 20 randomized CVLs were available for analysis. Mucosal IgG responses against four HIV-antigens were detected in 99% of MCs compared to only 80% of randomized CVLs (p = 0.029). Higher specific antibody activity and total antibodies were observed in MCs compared to CVL (all p<0.001). In MCs, 42/48 (88%) cytokines were in the detectable range in all participants compared to 27/48 (54%) in CVL (p<0.001). Concentrations of 22/41 cytokines (53.7%) were significantly higher in fluid collected by MC. Both total IgG (r = 0.63; p = 0.005) and cytokine concentrations (r = 0.90; p<0.001) correlated strongly between MC and corresponding post-MC CVL.\n",
      "MC sampling improves the detection of mucosal cytokines and antibodies, particularly those present at low concentrations. MC may therefore represent an ideal tool to assess immunological parameters in genital secretions, without interfering with concurrent collection of conventional CVL samples.\n",
      "To evaluate the clinical, nutritional and neurodevelopment status of HIV-infected children in a high HIV prevalence area.\n",
      "All HIV-infected children under 15 years of age attending an outpatient clinic of Mozambique between April and May 2010 were recruited. Clinical data were collected and physical examination was performed.\n",
      "In all, 140 children were recruited. The median age at HIV diagnosis was 2.1 years. Fifty-one percent of the children were classified in WHO clinical Stages 3 or 4. Median age of antiretroviral treatment commencement was 3.9 years. Overall, 68% were undernourished, mainly stunted. Forty-four percent failed to pass the national psychomotor developmental test.\n",
      "The pathways for early HIV diagnosis and start of antiretrovirals in children should be improved in Mozambique. Malnutrition, especially stunting, and developmental delay were highly prevalent. Further research focused on early diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and on the indications of antiretroviral treatment commencement based on chronic malnutrition is required.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Enzygnost HIV Integral II antigen/antibody combination ELISAs in order to formulate HIV ELISA testing algorithms for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Tanzania.\n",
      "This was a laboratory-based evaluation of Enzygnost HIV Integral II Antibody/ Antigen, Murex HIV antigen/antibody and Vironostika HIV Uniform II antigen/antibody conducted between October 2011 and May 2012.\n",
      "A total of 600 blood samples were included in the evaluation. A total of 209/596 (35.1%) serum samples were confirmed HIV positive. Of these, the prevalence of HIV infection was 2.3% (3/130), 2.3% (3/127), 2.2% (3/139) and 100% (200/200) for VCT clients, ANC attendees, blood donors and CTC patients, respectively. Three hundred and eighty seven (64.9%) were HIV negative samples. Sensitivity was 100% (95% CI; 98.3-100%) for all the three HIV ELISAs. The specificity for the Enzygnost HIV Integral II and Murex was 100% (95% CI; 99.1-100%). The final specificity at repeat testing was 99.5% (95% CI; 98.2-99.9%) for Vironostika. Enzygnost HIV Integral II detected HIV infection seven days since first bleed.\n",
      "Initial testing using either Vironostika or Murex HIV antigen/antibody combination ELISA followed by testing of reactive samples on the Enzygnost HIV Integral II gave a sensitivity and specificity of 100% with reduced window period. Combination of two HIV antigen/antibody combination ELISAs can be used as an alternative confirmatory testing strategy for screening of donated blood at the National and Zonal blood transfusion centres and in lab diagnosis of HIV infection.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to inform public health actions to limit first-line ART failure and HIV drug resistance in Mozambique.\n",
      "This was a cross-sectional study. HIV-1-infected adults on first-line ART for at least 1 year attending routine visits in the Manhiça District Hospital, in a semi-rural area in southern Mozambique with no HIV-1 RNA monitoring available, were evaluated for clinical, socio-demographic, therapeutic, immunological and virological characteristics. Factors associated with HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL and HIV drug resistance were determined using multivariate logistic regression.\n",
      "The study included 334 adults on first-line ART for a median of 3 years, of which 65% (214/332) had suppressed viraemia, 11% (37/332) had low-level viraemia (HIV-1 RNA 150-999 copies/mL) and 24% (81/332) had overt virological failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL). HIV drug resistance was detected in 89% of subjects with virological failure, but in none with low-level viraemia. Younger age [OR = 0.97 per additional year (95% CI = 0.94-1.00), P = 0.039], ART initiation at WHO stage III/IV [OR = 2.10 (95% CI = 1.23-3.57), P = 0.003] and low ART adherence [OR = 2.69 (95% CI = 1.39-5.19), P = 0.003] were associated with virological failure. Longer time on ART [OR = 1.55 per additional year (95% CI = 1.00-2.43), P = 0.052] and illiteracy [OR = 0.24 (95% CI = 0.07-0.89), P = 0.033] were associated with HIV drug resistance. Compared with HIV-1 RNA, clinician's judgement of ART failure, based on clinical and immunological outcomes, only achieved 29% sensitivity and misdiagnosed 1 out of every 4.5 subjects.\n",
      "Public health programmes in Mozambique should focus on early HIV diagnosis, early ART initiation and adherence support. Virological monitoring drastically improves the diagnosis of ART failure, enabling a better use of resources.\n",
      "Greater inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli and levels of human β defensin (HBD)-2 in genital tract secretions predicted HIV acquisition in women in the HPTN 035 trial. We investigated whether higher levels of E. coli inhibitory activity and antimicrobial peptides in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples predicted HIV acquisition in women in the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection Study. E. coli inhibitory activity and antimicrobial peptides were quantified in CVL from a subset of CAPRISA 002 participants who did not seroconvert (n=39) and from seroconverting women prior to infection (n=17) and during acute infection (n=11). Women who acquired HIV had significantly greater preinfection CVL E. coli inhibitory activity (p=0.01) and HBD-1 levels (p=0.02) compared to women who remained uninfected. Preinfection E. coli inhibitory activity remained significantly associated with seroconversion following adjustment for the presence of bacterial vaginosis (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.07, 1.97). Partial least squares discriminant analysis confirmed that preinfection CVL E. coli inhibitory activity, together with higher CVL concentrations of HBD-1 and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, distinguished seroconverters from nonseroconverters with 67% calibration accuracy. CVL concentrations of human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3 increased significantly with acute infection (p=0.001) and correlated with plasma viral set point (r=0.66, p=0.03). E. coli inhibitory activity in genital tract secretions could provide a biomarker of HIV risk. The correlation between HNP 1-3 and viral set point merits further investigation of the relationship between mucosal inflammation during early HIV infection and disease progression.\n",
      "This review was designed to evaluate the progress in studies of the use of oral and topical antiretroviral (ARV) medication for primary HIV prevention.\n",
      "Nonhuman primate data have suggested that the administration of ARV medication before or after retroviral exposure can protect against the establishment of chronic infection. Over the past two decades, observational studies have demonstrated the safety of ARV agents for postexposure prophylaxis and more recent efficacy studies have demonstrated that tenofovir with or without emtricitabine can protect against HIV when used as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Efficacy studies have been conducted in diverse populations, including men and transgender women who have sex with men, young African heterosexuals, and injection drug users. Three studies in African women evaluating oral and topical tenofovir-based regimens did not demonstrate efficacy, in large part because of suboptimal medication adherence. Further research is underway to determine the optimal ways to provide chemoprophylaxis, the optimal medications, and dosing regimens.\n",
      "PrEP can be effective in decreasing HIV transmission to at-risk uninfected persons, but further research is needed to determine the optimal modes of delivery.\n",
      "Early growth and health of HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) children is poorer than that of their HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) counterparts but there is little information about longer term effects of early HIV exposure. We previously recruited two cohorts of HEU and HUU Zambian infants and documented the poorer infant growth and health of the HEU compared to the HUU children. We followed up HEU and HUU children from these cohorts when they were school-aged and compared their growth, health, biochemical markers of acute or chronic disease, and school grades.\n",
      "We recruited 111 HEU and 279 HUU children aged 6-12 years. We measured anthropometry, determined health by questionnaire and clinical examination, viewed the child's most recent school report, and measured blood pressure, haemoglobin (Hb), HbA1c, glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (CRP).\n",
      "Anthropometric measures were lower among HEU than HUU children, significantly so for hip circumference (age- and sex-adjusted difference -1.74 cm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.24, -0.24; P = 0.023) and mid-upper-arm circumference (adjusted difference -0.63 cm, 95% CI -1.23, -0.04; P = 0.037) and with borderline effects for body mass index, thigh circumference and subscapular skinfolds. HEU children had significantly lower total, trunk, and limb fat percentages. All anthropometric and body composition differences became non-significant after adjustment for sociodemographic variables which differed between HEU and HUU children. More HEU than HUU children reported minor illnesses and were prescribed medication at the time of visit. There were no differences in biochemical markers between groups. HEU children had lower math grades than HUU children even after adjustment for socioeconomic variables.\n",
      "Although HEU children were smaller and had lower percent fat than HUU children, this appeared to be due mainly to their poorer socioeconomic status. Reasons for lower school grades require further research.\n",
      "Viral load (VL) testing is used for early HIV diagnosis in infants (EID) and for detecting early therapeutic failure events, but can be affected by HIV genetic variability. Dried blood samples (DBS) increase VL access and EID in remote settings and when low blood volume is available.\n",
      "This study compares VL values using Siemens VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 1.0 kPCR assay (kPCR) and Roche CAP/CTM Quantitative test v2.0 (CAP/CTM v2.0) in 176 DBS carrying different HIV-1 variants collected from 69 Equatoguinean mothers and their infants with known HIV-1 status (71 infected, 105 uninfected).\n",
      "CAP/CTM v2.0 provided false positive VLs in 11 (10.5%) cases. VL differences above 0.5 log10 were observed in 42/49 (87.5%) DBS, and were above 1 log10 in 18 cases. CAP/CTM v2.0 quantified all the 41 specimens with previously inferred HIV-1 variant by phylogenetic analysis (68.3% recombinants) whereas kPCR only identified 90.2% of them, and was unable to detect 14.3% of 21 CRF02_AG viruses. CAP/CTM v2.0 showed higher sensitivity than kPCR (95.8% vs. 70.1%), quantifying a higher rate of viruses in infected DBS from subjects under antiretroviral exposure at sampling time compared to kPCR (94.7% vs. 96.2%, p-value<0.001). kPCR showed maximum specificity (100%) whereas for CAP/CTM v2.0 was 89.5%.\n",
      "VL assays should increase their sensitivity and specificity to avoid overestimated HIV-1 quantifications, which could be interpreted as virological failure events, or false negative diagnostic results due to genetic variability. We recommend using the same VL technique for each patient during antiretroviral therapy monitoring.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of opportunistic infections (OIs) and associated factors among HIV-infected adults on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital, Eastern Ethiopia.\n",
      "A hospital-based retrospective study was conducted in 358 HIV-infected adult patients on ART from April to June 2014. Data were collected through review of clinical records. The data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 16.0. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of each independent variable with occurrence of OIs. A 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value less than 0.05 were considered as significant association.\n",
      "A total of 358 patients were included in the study, in which majority (68.4%) were females. The mean age of patients was 34 (standard deviation [SD] ±9.8) years. The overall of prevalence of OIs among HIV/AIDS patients on ART was 48%. The highest prevalent rates of OIs observed were tuberculosis (TB) (21.23%), followed by Herpes zoster (11.2%) and oral candidiasis (9.5%). Baseline CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =1.645, 95% CI =2.187, 3.983), baseline World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage III (AOR =2.801, 95% CI =1.958, 7.165) and IV (AOR =3.856; 95% CI =2.691, 10.390), and not using prophylaxis (AOR =1.912, 95% CI =1.444, 3.824) were found to have strong association with acquisition of OIs.\n",
      "There was a high prevalence of OIs observed in this study. Baselines CD4 count of <200 cells/mm(3), advanced WHO clinical stages, and not using prophylaxis were found to be predictors of OIs. Interventions were aimed at promoting early HIV testing and enrollment of HIV-infected individuals into ART services needed before CD4 count decreased severely.\n",
      "Foci of the HIV epidemic and helminthic infections largely overlap geographically. Treatment options for helminth infections are limited, and there is a paucity of drug-development research in this area. Limited evidence suggests that antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces prevalence of helminth infections in HIV-infected individuals. We investigated whether ART exposure and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CTX-P) is associated with a reduced prevalence of helminth infections.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary HIV-clinic in Lambaréné, Gabon. HIV-infected adults who were ART-naïve or exposed to ART for at least 3 months submitted one blood sample and stool and urine samples on 3 consecutive days. Outcome was helminth infection with intestinal helminths, Schistosoma haematobium, Loa loa or Mansonella perstans. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between ART or CTX-P and helminth infection. In total, 408 patients were enrolled. Helminth infection was common (77/252 [30.5%]). Filarial infections were most prevalent (55/310 [17.7%]), followed by infection with intestinal helminths (35/296 [11.8%]) and S. haematobium (19/323 [5.9%]). Patients on CTX-P had a reduced risk of Loa loa microfilaremia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.97, P = 0.04), also in the subgroup of patients on ART (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.96, P = 0.04). There was no effect of ART exposure on helminth infection prevalence.\n",
      "CTX-P use was associated with a decreased risk of Loa loa infection, suggesting an anthelminthic effect of antifolate drugs. No relation between ART use and helminth infections was established.\n",
      "Eliciting broadly reactive functional antibodies remains a challenge in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine development that is complicated by variations in envelope (Env) subtype and structure. The majority of new global HIV-1 infections are subtype C, and novel antigenic properties have been described for subtype C Env proteins. Thus, an HIV-1 subtype C Env protein (CO6980v0c22) from an infected person in the acute phase (Fiebig stage I/II) was developed as a research reagent and candidate immunogen. The gp145 envelope is a novel immunogen with a fully intact membrane-proximal external region (MPER), extended by a polylysine tail. Soluble gp145 was enriched for trimers that yielded the expected \"fan blade\" motifs when visualized by cryoelectron microscopy. CO6980v0c22 gp145 reacts with the 4E10, PG9, PG16, and VRC01 HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as the V1/V2-specific PGT121, 697, 2158, and 2297 MAbs. Different gp145 oligomers were tested for immunogenicity in rabbits, and purified dimers, trimers, and larger multimers elicited similar levels of cross-subtype binding and neutralizing antibodies to tier 1 and some tier 2 viruses. Immunized rabbit sera did not neutralize the highly resistant CO6980v0c22 pseudovirus but did inhibit the homologous infectious molecular clone in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay. This Env is currently in good manufacturing practice (GMP) production to be made available for use as a clinical research tool and further evaluation as a candidate vaccine.\n",
      "At present, the product pipeline for HIV vaccines is insufficient and is limited by inadequate capacity to produce large quantities of vaccine to standards required for human clinical trials. Such products are required to evaluate critical questions of vaccine formulation, route, dosing, and schedule, as well as to establish vaccine efficacy. The gp145 Env protein presented in this study forms physical trimers, binds to many of the well-characterized broad neutralizing MAbs that target conserved Env epitopes, and induce cross-subtype neutralizing antibodies as measured in both cell line and primary cell assays. This subtype C Env gp145 protein is currently undergoing good manufacturing practice production for use as a reagent for preclinical studies and for human clinical research. This product will serve as a reagent for comparative studies and may represent a next-generation candidate HIV immunogen.\n",
      "We pilot tested a Motivational Interviewing (MI) -based counseling intervention for individuals with Acute HIV Infection (AHI) to reduce risky sexual behavior in Lilongwe, Malawi.\n",
      "Twenty-eight individuals diagnosed with AHI were randomized to receive either brief education alone, or the brief education plus the MI-based intervention, called Uphungu Wanga. Participants in Uphungu Wanga received four sessions delivered on the day of diagnosis, three days later and at weeks 1 and 2 with a booster session at week 8; participants were followed for 24 weeks from diagnosis. An interviewer administered quantitative questionnaire was conducted at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Semi-structured qualitative interviews (SSI) were conducted at weeks 2, 8, 12, and 24.\n",
      "The majority of participants in both arms reported rapid and sustained behavior change following diagnosis with AHI. Very few participants reported having sex without a condom after diagnosis. Participants reported a trend towards fewer sex partners and abstaining from sex during study follow-up. Participants in the MI-based arm provided concrete examples of risk reduction strategies in the SSIs while those in the brief education arm primarily described reducing risk behavior, suggesting that the MI-based group may have acquired more risk reduction skills.\n",
      "Individuals in both study arms reduced risky sexual behaviors after diagnosis with AHI. We found few major differences between study arms during the 6-month follow up period in self-reported sexual behaviors therefore a MI-based intervention may not be needed to trigger behavior change following AHI. However, comparing the MI-based intervention to repeated brief education sessions made it difficult to assess the potential benefit of an MI-based intervention in a setting where standard counseling often consists of one post-test session. Nevertheless, provision of counseling immediately following diagnosis with HIV to support behavior change should remain a priority.\n",

Acute diarrhea was the second most common diagnosis among nonimmigrant travelers (n = 95 [12.3%]). Such common diagnoses as upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and influenza-like illness occurred in only 26, 9, and 7 returning travelers, respectively.

      "Understanding of progression to antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility and associated factors remains limited. The objectives of this analysis were to determine the time to ART eligibility and to explore factors associated with disease progression in adults with early HIV infection.\n",
      "HIV-infected adults (≥ 18 years old) with CD4 cell count > 500 cells/μl were enrolled in the study at three primary health care clinics, and a sociodemographic, behavioural and partnership-level questionnaire was administered. Participants were followed 6-monthly and ART eligibility was determined using a CD4 cell count threshold of 350 cells/μl. Kaplan - Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression modelling were used in the analysis.\n",
      "A total of 206 adults contributed 381 years of follow-up; 79 (38%) reached the ART eligibility threshold. Median time to ART eligibility was shorter for male patients (12.0 months) than for female patients (33.9 months). Male sex [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82-5.39], residing in a household with food shortage in the previous year (aHR 1.58; 95% CI 0.99-2.54), and taking nutritional supplements in the first 6 months after enrolment (aHR 2.06; 95% CI 1.11-3.83) were associated with shorter time to ART eligibility. Compared with reference CD4 cell count ≤  559 cells/μl, higher CD4 cell count was associated with longer time to ART eligibility [aHR 0.46 (95% CI 0.25-0.83) for CD4 cell count 560-632 cells/μl; aHR 0.30 (95% CI 0.16-0.57) for CD4 cell count 633-768 cells/μl; and aHR 0.17 (95% CI 0.08-0.38) for CD4 cell count > 768 cells/μl].\n",
      "Over one in three adults with CD4 cell count > 500 cells/μl became eligible for ART at a CD4 cell count threshold of 350 cells/μl over a median of 2 years. The shorter time to ART eligibility in male patients suggests a possible need for sex-specific pre-ART care and monitoring strategies.\n",
      "HIV transmission is most likely to occur during the first few months after infection, yet few cases are identified during this period. Using a population-based cohort of young Malawian women, we identify the distinct symptomology and health-seeking behavior marking early HIV infection by comparing it with periods of seronegativity and chronic infection. During early HIV infection, women are more likely to report malaria-like symptoms and visit clinics for malaria care. In malaria-endemic contexts, where acute HIV symptoms are commonly mistaken for malaria, early diagnostic HIV testing and counseling should be integrated into health care settings where people commonly seek treatment for malaria.\n",
      "This article combines local oral reminiscences with recent epidemiological literature to sketch a historical context around the onset and expansion of the HIV-1 epidemic in southern Uganda and north-western Tanzania. The local historical imagination has associated the appearance of AIDS in two ways. First, with specific socio-economic structures and circumstances common in the region since the 1960s and their enhancement during the 1970s due to economic changes at national and global levels. Second, the epidemic is associated with changes in the epidemiological situation. Local perspectives are supported by recent phylogenetic research and circumstantial historical evidence, on the basis of which a hypothesis on the expansion of HIV-1 in East Central Africa (southern Uganda, north-western Tanzania, Rwanda) is presented.\n",
      "South Africa has made substantial progress on child and maternal mortality, yet many avoidable deaths of mothers and children still occur. This analysis identifies priority interventions to be scaled up nationally and projects the potential maternal and child lives saved.\n",
      "We modelled the impact of maternal, newborn and child interventions using the Lives Saved Tools Projections to 2015 and used realistic coverage increases based on expert opinion considering recent policy change, financial and resource inputs, and observed coverage change. A scenario analysis was undertaken to test the impact of increasing intervention coverage to 95%.\n",
      "By 2015, with realistic coverage, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) can reduce to 153 deaths per 100,000 and child mortality to 34 deaths per 1,000 live births. Fifteen interventions, including labour and delivery management, early HIV treatment in pregnancy, prevention of mother-to-child transmission and handwashing with soap, will save an additional 9,000 newborns and children and 1,000 mothers annually. An additional US$370 million (US$7 per capita) will be required annually to scale up these interventions. When intervention coverage is increased to 95%, breastfeeding promotion becomes the top intervention, the MMR reduces to 116 and the child mortality ratio to 23.\n",
      "The 15 interventions identified were adopted by the National Department of Health, and the Health Minister launched a campaign to encourage Provincial Health Departments to scale up coverage. It is hoped that by focusing on implementing these 15 interventions at high quality, South Africa will reach Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 soon after 2015 and MDG 5 several years later. Focus on HIV and TB during early antenatal care is essential. Strategic gains could be realised by targeting vulnerable populations and districts with the worst health outcomes. The analysis demonstrates the usefulness of priority setting tools and the potential for evidence-based decision making in the health sector.\n",
      "Few studies have described time-based trends of clinical and demographic characteristics of children enrolling in HIV and AIDS care and treatment services. We present findings of a study that explored time-based trends of baseline characteristics among children enrolling into 26 public HIV care facilities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n",
      "Children enrolled between October 2004 and September 2011 was included in these analyses. The year of enrollment was used as the primary predictor of interest, and log linear and linear regressions model were used to analyze dichotomous and continuous variables respectively. P-values under 0.05 were considered significant.\n",
      "Among the 6,579 children enrolled, the proportion with advanced disease at enrollment increased from 35% to 58%, mean age increasing from 5.0 to 6.2 years (p < 0.0001), proportion of children less than 2 years decreased from 35% to 29%. While the median hemoglobin concentration rose from 9.1 g/dl to 10.3 g/dl (P <0.0001), proportion with a history of past TB dropped from 25% to 12.8% (P < 0.0001). Over time, health centers and dispensaries enrolled more children as compared to hospitals (P < 0.0001). Temeke district, which has the lowest socioeconomic status among the three districts in Dar es Salaam, had a significant increase in enrollment from 22% to 25% (P = 0.02).\n",
      "We found that as time progressed, children were enrolled in care and treatment services at an older age sicker status as evidenced by increase in mean age and more advanced disease stage at first contact with providers. We recommend more efforts be focused on scaling up early HIV infant diagnosis and enrollment to HIV care and treatment.\n",
      "\"Medical pluralism\" is the use of multiple health systems and is common among people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Healers and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) often are a patient's first and/or preferred line of treatment; this often results in delayed, interrupted, or abandoned diagnosis and therapy. Literature from the study of medical pluralism suggests that HIV care and treatment programs are infrequently and inconsistently engaging healers around the world. Mistrust and misunderstanding among patients, clinical providers, and traditional practitioners make the development of effective partnerships difficult, particularly regarding early HIV diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy. We provide recommendations for the development of successful collaboration health workforce efforts based on both published articles and case studies from our work in rural Mozambique.\n",
      "We used an individual-based model to evaluate the effects of hypothetical prevention interventions on HIV incidence trajectories in a concentrated, mixed epidemic setting from 2011 to 2021, and using Cabo Verde as an example.\n",
      "Simulations were conducted to evaluate the extent to which early HIV treatment and optimization of care, HIV testing, condom distribution, and substance abuse treatment could eliminate new infections (i.e., reduce incidence to less than 10 cases per 10,000 person-years) among non-drug users, female sex workers (FSW), and people who use drugs (PWUD).\n",
      "Scaling up all four interventions resulted in the largest decreases in HIV, with estimates ranging from 1.4 (95 % CI 1.36-1.44) per 10,000 person-years among non-drug users to 8.2 (95 % CI 7.8-8.6) per 10,000 person-years among PWUD in 2021. Intervention scenarios prioritizing FWS and PWUD also resulted in HIV incidence estimates at or below 10 per 10,000 person-years by 2021 for all population sub-groups.\n",
      "Our results suggest that scaling up multiple interventions among entire population is necessary to achieve elimination. However, prioritizing key populations with this combination prevention strategy may also result in a substantial decrease in total incidence.\n",

      "We used routinely collected programme data in supported sites from June 1 2009 to September 30, 2013.Baseline characteristics were defined as those collected closest to a 90-day window period before and after enrolment. Summary characteristics were compared by site and enrolment year.\n",
      "We enrolled 3,960 HIV-infected patients into care (68% women), median age of 32 years [interquartile range (IQR): 27-40]. Most clients were married (79%) and unemployed (60%). At enrolment, median CD4+ cell count was 230 cells/μL (IQR: 114-390) and haemoglobin was 10.7 g/dL (IQR: 9.3-11.9). Advanced clinical disease [World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage III/IV] at enrolment was documented in 29% of clients. Cumulative enrolment increased from 377 patients in 2009 to 3,960 patients by 2013.With each successive year, more clients were enrolled at earlier stages of disease; in 2009, 37% of patients were identified as WHO clinical stage I, while in 2013, 55% of patients were so classified. While documentation of clinical staging remained stable, the completeness of CD4+ cell count and haemoglobin data declined with time.\n",
      "Expanded testing in a comprehensive HIV programme in rural Nigeria brought persons to care at earlier stages of illness. Yet, as clinical services expanded, data collection quality declined. The paradox of successful scaling up HIV services but deteriorating quality of data underscores the importance of data management training and quality improvement efforts.\n",
      "The relevance of superinfection as a model to identify correlates of protection against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depends on whether the superinfecting transmission resembles primary infection, which has not been established. Here, we characterize the genetic bottleneck in superinfected individuals for the first time. In all 3 cases, superinfection produced a spike in viral load and could be traced to a single, C-C chemokine receptor 5-tropic founder virus with shorter, less glycosylated variable regions than matched chronic viruses. These features are consistent with primary HIV transmission and provide support for the use of superinfection as a model to address correlates of protection against HIV.\n",
      "Point-of-care (POC) HIV viral load (VL) testing offers the potential to reduce turnaround times for antiretroviral therapy monitoring, offer near-patient acute HIV diagnosis in adults, extend existing centralized VL services, screen women in labor, and prompt pediatrics to early treatment. The Liat HIV Quant plasma and whole-blood assays, prerelease version, were evaluated in South Africa. The precision, accuracy, linearity, and agreement of the Liat HIV Quant whole-blood and plasma assays were compared to those of reference technologies (Roche CAP CTMv2.0 and Abbott RealTime HIV-1) on an HIV verification plasma panel (n = 42) and HIV clinical specimens (n = 163). HIV Quant plasma assay showed good performance, with a 2.7% similarity coefficient of variation (CV) compared to the Abbott assay and a 1.8% similarity CV compared to the Roche test on the verification panel, and 100% specificity. HIV Quant plasma had substantial agreement (pc [concordance correlation] = 0.96) with Roche on clinical specimens and increased variability (pc = 0.73) in the range of <3.0 log copies/ml range with the HIV Quant whole-blood assay. HIV Quant plasma assay had good linearity (2.0 to 5.0 log copies/ml; R(2) = 0.99). Clinical sensitivity at a viral load of 1,000 copies/ml of the HIV Quant plasma and whole-blood assays compared to that of the Roche assay (n = 94) was 100% (confidence interval [CI], 95.3% to 100%). The specificity of HIV Quant plasma was 88.2% (CI, 63.6% to 98.5%), and that for whole blood was 41.2% (CI, 18.4% to 67.1%). No virological failure (downward misclassification) was missed. Liat HIV Quant plasma assay can be interchanged with existing VL technology in South Africa. Liat HIV Quant whole-blood assay would be advantageous for POC early infant diagnosis at birth and adult adherence monitoring and needs to be evaluated further in this clinical context. LIAT cartridges currently require cold storage, but the technology is user-friendly and robust. Clinical cost and implementation modeling is required.\n",
      "The outcome of HIV treatment has dramatically improved since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy. Studies confirm that if treatment of HIV is initiated when the immune system is not severely affected by the virus the prognosis for the outcome is significantly better. There is also evidence that many immigrants come late for their first HIV test. If found to be HIV positive, and if the immune system is already significantly affected, this will compromise the treatment outcome. This study was performed in an attempt to understand the barriers for early HIV testing in a migrant population from Ethiopia and Eritrea in Stockholm, Sweden.\n",
      "Participants were theoretically sampled and consisted of individuals who had immigrated from Ethiopia and Eritrea. Data were collected using 14 focus group discussions and seven semi-structured interviews. The analysis was performed according to a Grounded Theory approach using the paradigm model.\n",
      "Denial and fear of knowing one's HIV status dominated all aspects of behavior in relation to HIV. The main strategy was a \"fogging\" of the issue of HIV. People were said to not want to know because this would bring social isolation and exclusion, and it was often believed that treatment did not help. This attitude had strong roots in their culture and past experiences that were brought along to the new country and maintained within the immigrant community. The length of time spent in Sweden seemed to be an important factor affecting the \"fogging of the HIV issue\".\n",
      "In bridging the gap between the two cultures, Swedish authorities need to find ways to meet the needs of both earlier and newly arrived immigrants as well as the second generation of immigrants. This will require adjusting and updating the information that is given to these different sub-groups of Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants. Appropriate access to healthcare for a diverse population obviously requires more than simply providing the healthcare services.\n",
      "Antiretroviral drug resistance is a major challenge for management and control of HIV-1 infection worldwide and particularly in resource limited countries. The frequency of primary drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and of naturally occurring polymorphisms was determined in 83 antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve Ethiopian individuals infected with HIV-1, consecutively enrolled in 2010. In all individuals HIV-1C was found. The median (interquartile range) of CD4(+) T-cell count and viral load were 100 (49-201) cells/μl and 44,640 (12,553-134,664) copies/ml, respectively. Protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of HIV-1 RNA were amplified and sequenced. The proportion of primary DRM to any drug class, using the World Health Organization mutation lists, was 7.2% (6/83), thus exceeding the WHO threshold limit of 5%. Three individuals (3.6%) had non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, two individuals (2.4%) had protease inhibitor mutations, and one (1.2%) had mutations associated with two drug classes (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and NNRTI). In addition, the frequency of polymorphisms in the PR and RT genes was higher compared with previous studies in Ethiopian as well as worldwide isolates. Hence, genotypic drug resistance testing as part of routine management of individuals seems reasonable even in resource limited countries prior to treatment in order to allow proper choice of ART.\n",
      "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to reduce AIDS- defining illnesses, including neuropathies. However, it has been postulated that an increase in age -, HIV- and HAART- related neurological complications will occur as HIV-infected persons live longer. This study investigated the frequency and outcome of neuropathies in relation to CD4+ cell count and HAART status of hospitalised HIV/AIDS patients in Shika.\n",
      "Consecutive adult (e\"15 years) non pregnant HIV- infected patients treated at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Shika-Zaria from January 2006 to May 2013 with neuropathies were studied. Non HIV-infected patients with neurological disorders and HIV-infected patients without neuropathies were excluded.\n",
      "Of 5240 HIV/AIDS patients seen , 11% (566) presented with neuropathy at median CD4+ cell counts of 200 cells / ul, with yearly reduction of the frequency of patients with neuropathy from 3.9% in 2006 to 0.06% in 2013. Male: female ratio was 2:1 and respective mean years were 41.9±10.1: 45.3±17.4 (p<0.00). 253 (45%) were on HAART at presentation. 40 patients died and the mortality was associated with recurrent seizures, CD4+ cell counts d\" 100 / ul, male sex, HAART-naivety and presence of co-morbidity and complications.\n",
      "The progressive reduction in the yearly frequency of neuropathy among HIV/AIDS patients suggests a beneficial effect of HAART on neuropathies. However, late presentation, low CD4+ cell counts and failure of patients to start HAART early were responsible for AIDS-related mortality thus highlighting the importance of early HIV screening and treatment.\n",
      "Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) refers to the period between viral transmission and development of an adaptive immune response to HIV antigens (seroconversion) usually lasting 6-8 weeks. Rare cases have been described in which HIV-infected patients fail to seroconvert and instead, develop rapid HIV-mediated clinical decline. We report the case of a Mozambican woman with AHI and malaria coinfection who showed atypical seroconversion and experienced rapid deterioration and death within 14 weeks of diagnosis with AHI. Atypical seroconversion may be associated with rapid progression. Fourth generation rapid tests could lead to earlier identification and intervention for this vulnerable subgroup.\n",
      "The Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) can manifest neurologically in both adults and children. Early invasion of the central nervous system by the virus, affecting the developing brain, is believed to result in the most common primary HIV-related neurological complication, HIV Encephalopathy (HIVE). In countries such as South Africa where many children have not been initiated on antiretroviral treatment early, HIVE remains a significant clinical problem.\n",
      "Children were selected from a clinic for children with neurologic complications of HIV, located at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, South Africa 2008-2012. Eligible subjects fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: aged 6 months-13 years; positive diagnosis of HIV infection, vertically infected and HIVE as defined by CDC criteria. Each participant was prospectively assessed by a Pediatric Neurologist using a standardized proforma which collated relevant details of background, clinical and immunological status.\n",
      "The median age of the 87 children was 64 months (interquartile range 27-95 months). All except one child were on antiretroviral treatment, 45% had commenced treatment <12 months of age. Delayed early motor milestones were reported in 80% and delayed early speech in 75% of children in whom we had the information. Twenty percent had a history of one or more seizures and 41% had a history of behavior problems. Forty-eight percent had microcephaly and 63% a spastic diplegia. CD4 percentages followed a normal distribution with mean of 30.3% (SD 8.69). Viral loads were undetectable (<log 1.6) in 70% of the children. Brain imaging was performed on 56% with 71% of those imaged demonstrating at least one abnormality, most commonly white matter volume loss or signal abnormality.\n",
      "Amongst the cohort of children referred to this clinic, the diagnosis of HIVE was unrecognized in the general medical services, even in its most severe form. Developmental delay and school failure were major presenting problems. Co-morbidities are a frequent finding and should be sought actively in order to optimize management and promote best possible outcomes for this vulnerable group of children.\n",
      "Control of virus replication in HIV-1 infection is critical to delaying disease progression. While cellular immune responses are a key determinant of control, relatively little is known about the contribution of the infecting virus to this process. To gain insight into this interplay between virus and host in viral control, we conducted a detailed analysis of two heterosexual HIV-1 subtype A transmission pairs in which female recipients sharing three HLA class I alleles exhibited contrasting clinical outcomes: R880F controlled virus replication while R463F experienced high viral loads and rapid disease progression. Near full-length single genome amplification defined the infecting transmitted/founder (T/F) virus proteome and subsequent sequence evolution over the first year of infection for both acutely infected recipients. T/F virus replicative capacities were compared in vitro, while the development of the earliest cellular immune response was defined using autologous virus sequence-based peptides. The R880F T/F virus replicated significantly slower in vitro than that transmitted to R463F. While neutralizing antibody responses were similar in both subjects, during acute infection R880F mounted a broad T cell response, the most dominant components of which targeted epitopes from which escape was limited. In contrast, the primary HIV-specific T cell response in R463F was focused on just two epitopes, one of which rapidly escaped. This comprehensive study highlights both the importance of the contribution of the lower replication capacity of the transmitted/founder virus and an associated induction of a broad primary HIV-specific T cell response, which was not undermined by rapid epitope escape, to long-term viral control in HIV-1 infection. It underscores the importance of the earliest CD8 T cell response targeting regions of the virus proteome that cannot mutate without a high fitness cost, further emphasizing the need for vaccines that elicit a breadth of T cell responses to conserved viral epitopes.\n",
      "Fourth-generation HIV assays detect both antigen and antibody, facilitating detection of acute/early HIV infection. The Bio-Rad GS HIV Combo Ag/Ab assay (Bio-Rad Combo) is an enzyme immunoassay that simultaneously detects HIV p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 in serum or plasma.\n",
      "To evaluate the performance of the Bio-Rad Combo assay for detection of HIV infection in adults from Southern Africa.\n",
      "Samples were obtained from adults in Soweto and Vulindlela, South Africa and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (300 HIV-positive samples; 300 HIV-negative samples; 12 samples from individuals previously classified as having acute/early HIV infection). The samples were tested with the Bio-Rad Combo assay. Additional testing was performed to characterize the 12 acute/early samples.\n",
      "All 300 HIV-positive samples were reactive using the Bio-Rad Combo assay; false positive test results were obtained for 10 (3.3%) of the HIV-negative samples (sensitivity: 100%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.8-100%); specificity: 96.7%, 95% CI: 94.0-98.4%). The assay detected 10 of the 12 infections classified as acute/early. The two infections that were not detected had viral loads<400 copies/mL; one of those samples contained antiretroviral drugs consistent with antiretroviral therapy.\n",
      "The Bio-Rad Combo assay correctly classified the majority of study specimens. The specificity reported here may be higher than that seen in other settings, since HIV-negative samples were pre-screened using a different fourth-generation test. The assay also had high sensitivity for detection of acute/early infection. False-negative test results may be obtained in individuals who are virally suppressed.\n",
      "Prevention of acute HIV infections in pregnancy is required to achieve elimination of pediatric HIV. Identification and support for HIV negative pregnant women and their partners, particularly serodiscordant couples, are critical. A mixed method study done in Southern Mozambique estimated HIV incidence during pregnancy, associated risk factors and factors influencing partner's HIV testing.\n",
      "Between April 2008 and November 2011, a prospective cohort of 1230 HIV negative pregnant women was followed during pregnancy. A structured questionnaire, HIV testing, and collection of dried blood spots were done at 2-3 scheduled visits. HIV incidence rates were calculated by repeat HIV testing and risk factors assessed by Poisson regression. A qualitative study including 37 individual interviews with men, women, and nurses and 11 focus group discussions (n = 94) with men, women and grandmothers explored motivators and barriers to uptake of male HIV testing.\n",
      "HIV incidence rate was estimated at 4.28/100 women-years (95%CI: 2.33-7.16). Significant risk factors for HIV acquisition were early sexual debut (RR 3.79, 95%CI: 1.04-13.78, p = 0.04) and living in Maputo Province (RR 4.35, 95%CI: 0.97-19.45, p = 0.05). Nineteen percent of women reported that their partner had tested for HIV (93% knew the result with 8/213 indicating an HIV positive partner), 56% said their partner had not tested and 19% did not know their partner test status. Of the 14 seroconversions, only one reported being in a serodiscordant relationship. Fear of discrimination or stigma was reported as a key barrier to male HIV testing, while knowing the importance of getting tested and receiving care was the main motivator.\n",

      "Adults in developing countries frequently use community pharmacies as the first and often only source of care. The objective of this study was to assess the success of pharmacy referrals and uptake of HIV testing by young adult clients of community pharmacies in the context of a screening programme for acute HIV-1 infection (AHI).\n",
      "We requested five pharmacies to refer clients meeting predefined criteria (ie, 18-29 years of age and requesting treatment for fever, diarrhoea, sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms or body pains) for HIV-1 testing and AHI screening at selected clinics. Using multivariable logistical regression, we determined client characteristics associated with HIV-1 test uptake.\n",
      "From February through July 2013, 1490 pharmacy clients met targeting criteria (range of weekly averages across pharmacies: 4-35). Of these, 1074 (72%) accepted a referral coupon, 377 (25%) reported at a study clinic, 353 (24%) were HIV-1 tested and 127 (9%) met criteria for the AHI study. Of those tested, 14 (4.0%) were HIV-1 infected. Test uptake varied significantly by referring pharmacy and was higher for clients who presented at the pharmacy without a prescription versus those with a prescription, and for clients who sought care for STI symptoms.\n",
      "About a quarter of targeted pharmacy clients took up HIV-1 testing. Clients seeking care directly at the pharmacy (ie, without a prescription) and those with STI symptoms were more likely to take up HIV-1 testing. Engagement of adult pharmacy clients for HIV-1 screening may identify undiagnosed individuals and offers opportunities for HIV-1 prevention research.\n",
      "Point-of-care testing and diagnosis of HIV acute infections play important roles in preventing transmission, but HIV rapid diagnosis tests have poor capacity to detect early infections. Filter paper can be used for capillary blood collection and HIV testing using 4th generation immunoassays.\n",
      "Antigen/antibody combined immunoassays were evaluated for their capacity to identify early HIV infections using filter paper in comparison with rapid test.\n",
      "Thirty nine serum samples collected from HIV seroconverters were spotted onto filter paper and tested by the Roche Elecsys(®) HIV Combi PT test and the DiaSorin Liaison XL Murex HIV Ab/Ag assay.\n",
      "Fourth generation immunoassays identified 34 out of 39 HIV early infections using dried serum spot, whereas the Determine™ HIV-1/2 rapid test detected 24 out of 39 HIV positive serum (87.2% vs 61.5% respectively, p = 0.009). p24 antigen was detected by the Liaison XL in 19 dried serum samples (48.7%). In the group characterized by a negative western blot, 7 out of 8 (87.5%) and 6 out of 8 (75.0%) samples were found positive for HIV using the Elecsys and the Liaison XL, respectively. None of these eight samples classified in this group of early acute infections were found positive by the rapid test.\n",
      "Fourth generation Ag/Ab immunoassays performed on dried serum spot had good performance for HIV testing during the early phases of HIV infection. This method may be useful to detect HIV early infections in hard-to-reach populations and individuals living in remote areas before rapid tests become positive.\n",

      "This was a retrospective patient record review of 3919 HIV-infected patients aged ≥15 years who initiated ART between 2007 and 2009 in 40 randomly selected ART facilities countrywide.\n",
      "Compared to females, males had more documented active tuberculosis (12% vs. 9%; p<0.02) and a lower median CD4 cell count (117 cells/μl vs. 143 cells/μl; p<0.001) at ART initiation. Males had a higher risk of attrition (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.49) and mortality (AHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.10-2.20). Factors associated with attrition for both sexes were lower baseline weight (<45kg and 45-60kg vs. >60kg), initiating ART at an urban health facility, and care at central/provincial or district/mission hospitals vs. primary healthcare facilities.\n",
      "Our findings show that males presented late for ART initiation compared to females. Similar to other studies, males had higher patient attrition and mortality compared to females and this may be attributed in part to late presentation for HIV treatment and care. These observations highlight the need to encourage early HIV testing and enrolment into HIV treatment and care, and eventually patient retention on ART, particularly amongst men.\n",

Participants attended monthly or quarterly follow-up visits for up to 36 months. Annually, syphilis serology testing was done and male circumcision status was assessed. We used multivariate Andersen-Gill survival methods, adjusted for age, sexual behaviour, and plasma HIV RNA levels of the HIV-infected partner.\n",

At enrolment, 1575 (53%) men with HIV and 560 (32%) men without HIV were circumcised; an additional 69 (4%) men with HIV and 132 (5%) men without HIV were circumcised during study follow-up. 221 incident syphilis infections were reported: 46 (21%) in men with HIV (incidence 1·10 per 100 person-years), 76 (34%) in men without HIV (1·09), 54 (24%) in women with HIV (0·77), and 45 (24%) in women without HIV (1·11). Male circumcision was associated with a 42% reduction in incident syphilis in men (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0·58, 95% CI 0·37-0·91) including a 62% reduction in men with HIV (0·38, 0·18-0·81), and a non-significant reduction in incident syphilis in men without HIV (0·64, 0·36-1·11). In women, circumcision of their male partners was associated with a 59% reduction in incident syphilis (aHR 0·41, 95% CI 0·25-0·69), including a 75% reduction in women without HIV (0·25, 0·08-0·76) and a 48% reduction in women with HIV (0·52, 0·27-0·97).\n",

      "Home visits by community health workers (CHW) could be effective in identifying pregnant women in the community before they have presented to the health system. CHW could thus improve the uptake of antenatal care (ANC), HIV testing, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services.\n",
      "Over a 16-month period, we carried out a quantitative evaluation of the performance of CHW in reaching women early in pregnancy and before they have attended ANC in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n",
      "As part of the intervention, 213 CHW conducted more than 45,000 home visits to about 43,000 pregnant women. More than 75% of the pregnant women identified through home visits had not yet attended ANC at the time of the first contact with a CHW and about 40% of those who had not yet attended ANC were in the first trimester of pregnancy. Over time, the number of pregnant women the CHW identified each month increased, as did the proportion of women who had not yet attended ANC. The median gestational age of pregnant women contacted for the first time by a CHW decreased steadily and significantly over time (from 21/22 to 16 weeks, P-value for test of trend <0.0001).\n",
      "A large-scale CHW intervention was effective in identifying pregnant women in their homes early in pregnancy and before they had attended ANC.

      "Despite normalization of total CD4 counts, ongoing immune dysfunction is noted amongst those on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Low CD4/CD8 ratio is associated with a high risk of AIDS and non-AIDS events and may act as a marker of immune senescence [1]. This ratio is improved by ART although normalization is uncommon (~7%) [2]. The probability of normalization of CD4 count is improved with immediate ART initiation in primary HIV infection (PHI) [3]. We examined whether CD4/CD8 ratio similarly normalized in immediate vs. deferred ART at PHI.\n",
      "Using data from the SPARTAC trial and the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters, we examined the effect of ART with time (continuous) from HIV seroconversion (SC) on CD4/CD8 ratio (≥1) adjusted for sex, risk group, ethnicity, enrolment from an African site and both CD4 count and age at ART initiation. We also examined that effect by dichotomizing HIV duration at ART initiation (ART started within six months of SC: early ART; ART initiated>six months after SC: deferred). We also considered time to CD4 count normalization (≥900 cells/mm(3)).\n",
      "In total, 353 initiated ART with median (IQR) 97.9 (60.5, 384.5) days from estimated seroconversion; 253/353 early ART, 100 deferred ART. At one year after starting ART, 114/253 (45%) early ART had normalized CD4/8 ratio, compared with 11/99 (11%) in the deferred group, whilst 83/253 (33%) of early ART had normalized CD4 counts, compared with 3/99 (3%) in the deferred group. Individuals initiating within six months of PHI were significantly more likely to reach normal ratio than those initiating later (HR, 95% CI 2.96, 1.75 - 5.01, p<0.001). The longer after SC ART was initiated, the reduced likelihood of achieving normalization of CD4/CD8 ratio (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 - 0.99 for each 30-day increase). CD4 count at ART initiation was also associated with normalization, as expected (HR 1.002, 95% CI 1.001 - 1.002, p<0.001). There was an association between normal CD4/CD8 ratio and being virally suppressed (<400 copies HIV RNA/ml) p<0.001. CD4 count normalization was also significantly more likely for those initiating early (HR 5.00, 95% CI 1.52 - 16.41, p=0.008).\n",
      "The likelihood of achieving normalization of CD4/CD8 ratios was increased if ART was initiated within six months of PHI. Higher CD4/CD8 ratio may reflect a more \"normal\" immune phenotype conferring enhanced prognosis and predict post-treatment control.\n",
      "The risk of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) among HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not well defined in resource-limited settings. We studied KS incidence rates and associated risk factors in children and adults on ART in Southern Africa.\n",
      "We included patient data of 6 ART programs in Botswana, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. We estimated KS incidence rates in patients on ART measuring time from 30 days after ART initiation to KS diagnosis, last follow-up visit, or death. We assessed risk factors (age, sex, calendar year, WHO stage, tuberculosis, and CD4 counts) using Cox models.\n",
      "We analyzed data from 173,245 patients (61% female, 8% children aged <16 years) who started ART between 2004 and 2010. Five hundred and sixty-four incident cases were diagnosed during 343,927 person-years (pys). The overall KS incidence rate was 164/100,000 pys [95% confidence interval (CI): 151 to 178]. The incidence rate was highest 30-90 days after ART initiation (413/100,000 pys; 95% CI: 342 to 497) and declined thereafter [86/100,000 pys (95% CI: 71 to 105), >2 years after ART initiation]. Male sex [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.34; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.61], low current CD4 counts (≥500 versus <50 cells/μL, adjusted HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.55), and age (5-9 years versus 30-39 years, adjusted HR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.79) were relevant risk factors for developing KS.\n",

      "Detection of early HIV infections (EHIs), including acute HIV infection (AHI), is important for individual health, prevention of HIV transmission, and measurement of HIV incidence. We describe markers of EHI, diagnostic strategies for detecting these markers, and ways to incorporate these strategies into diagnostic and HIV incidence algorithms.\n",
      "For individual diagnosis in the USA and Europe, laboratory-based diagnostic algorithms increasingly incorporate fourth-generation HIV antigen tests, allowing for earlier detection. In some sub-Saharan African settings, symptom-based screening is being explored to identify subsets of persons at high risk for AHI. Point-of-care diagnostics designed for AHI detection are in the pipeline and, if validated, represent an opportunity for real-time AHI diagnosis. At the population level, multiassay algorithms are promising new strategies for estimating HIV incidence on the basis of several assays applied to cross-sectional samples. These algorithms can be developed to optimize performance, in addition to cost and logistical considerations.\n",
      "There are important recent advances in detection of EHIs at the individual and population levels. Applying optimal combinations of tests in diagnostic and HIV incidence algorithms is urgently needed to support the multiple goals derived from enhanced detection and discrimination of EHIs.\n",
      "We characterized protein-specific CD8 T-cell immunodominance patterns during the first year of HIV-1 infection, and their impact on viral evolution and immune control.\n",
      "We analyzed CD8 T-cell responses to the full HIV-1 proteome during the first year of infection in 18 antiretroviral-naïve individuals with acute HIV-1 subtype C infection, all identified prior to seroconversion. Ex-vivo and cultured interferon-γ ELISPOT assays were performed and viruses from plasma were sequenced within defined CTL Gag epitopes.\n",
      "Nef-specific CD8 T-cell responses were dominant during the first 4 weeks after infection and made up 40% of the total responses at this time; yet, by 1 year, responses against this region had declined and Gag responses made up to 47% of all T-cell responses measured. An inverse correlation between the breadth of Gag-specific responses and viral load set point was evident at 26 weeks after infection (P = 0.0081, r = -0.60) and beyond. An inverse correlation between the number of persistent responses targeting Gag and viral set point was also identified (P = 0.01, r = -0.58). Gag-specific responses detectable by the cultured ELISPOT assay correlated negatively with viral load set point (P = 0.0013, r = -0.91). Sequence evolution in targeted and nontargeted Gag epitopes in this cohort was infrequent.\n",
      "These data underscore the importance of HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses, particularly to the Gag protein, in the maintenance of low viral load levels during primary infection, and show that these responses are initially poorly elicited by natural infection. These data have implications for vaccine design strategies.\n",
      "Worldwide, women account for a growing percentage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and more than half of all HIV infections. For many years, morphologic imaging methods were the main approaches employed to investigate HIV and its complications. However, during the past decade, advancements in PET and SPECT imaging technologies opened new possibilities for improved understanding of the pathophysiological processes in HIV. Diagnosis of early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is important, as many of its symptoms can be caused by other conditions common to people with HIV/AIDS. Presently, there are no PET and SPECT tracers or combination of markers for HAND, hence novel HAND-specific tracers are needed if nuclear medicine is to play a role in solving the problem of the HAND \"epidemic.\" As both highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-induced lipoatrophy and cardiovascular diseases are characterized by ongoing inflammation, FDG-PET/CT imaging may represent an important imaging technique for better understanding the metabolic risk in HIV-infected women on HAART. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for the development of human papilloma virus-associated neoplasms such as cervical and anal carcinomas; these aggressive tumors could be treated better with integration of FDG-PET as part of the standard pretreatment workup. A similar value of FDG-PET may be realized in women with HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma, as they have more extensive cutaneous disease than men do. In the era of HAART, the incidence and local invasiveness of breast cancer may change, thus creating a need to redefine the pathophysiology of breast cancer in HIV-positive women. Finally, mammary tuberculosis, occasionally the presenting symptom in HIV-infected women, may present with nonspecific clinical, radiological, and histologic findings. In these women, FDG-PET can be of value to detect the lesion for a representative biopsy, staging to exclude pulmonary and other extrapulmonary lesions, and also for therapy monitoring.\n",
      "Circular migrations are the periodic movement of individuals between multiple locations, observed in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Relationships between circular migrations and HIV are complex, entailing interactions between migration frequency, partnership structure, and exposure to acute HIV infection. Mathematical modeling is a useful tool for understanding these interactions. Two modeling classes have dominated the HIV epidemiology and policy literature for the last decade: one a form of compartmental models, the other network models. We construct models from each class, using ordinary differential equations and exponential random graph models, respectively. Our analysis suggests that projected HIV prevalence is highly sensitive to the choice of modeling framework. Assuming initial equal HIV prevalence across locations, compartmental models show no association between migration frequency and HIV prevalence or incidence, while network models show that migrations at frequencies shorter than the acute HIV period predict greater HIV incidence and prevalence compared to longer migration periods. These differences are statistically significant when network models are extended to incorporate a requirement for migrant men's multiple partnerships to occur in different locations. In settings with circular migrations, commonly-used forms of compartmental models appear to miss key components of HIV epidemiology stemming from interactions of relational and viral dynamics.\n",
      "Nigeria is a key target country in the global effort toward elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Low coverage of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions, adherence, and retention-in-care rates in HIV-positive pregnant women are contributing factors to high mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) rates. In Nigeria, rural areas, served largely by primary health care facilities, have particularly poor indicators of PMTCT coverage. Mentor Mothers are HIV-positive women who serve as peer counselors for PMTCT clients, provide guidance, and support in keeping appointments and promoting antiretroviral adherence and retention-in-care. The Mother Mentor (MoMent) study aims to investigate the impact of structured Mentor Mother programs on PMTCT outcomes in rural Nigeria.\n",
      "A prospective cohort study will compare rates of retention-in-care among PMTCT clients who are supported by formally-trained supervised Mentor Mothers versus clients who receive standard-of-care, informal peer support. Study sites are 20 primary health care centers (10 intervention, 10 control) in rural North-Central Nigeria. The study population is HIV-positive mothers and exposed infant pairs (MIPs) (N = 480; 240 MIPs per study arm). Primary outcome measures are the proportion of exposed infants receiving early HIV testing by age 2 months, and the proportion of MIPs retained in care at 6 months postpartum. Secondary outcome measures examine antiretroviral adherence, 12-month postpartum MIP retention, and MTCT rates. This article presents details of the study design, the structured Mentor Mother programs, and how their impact on PMTCT outcomes will be assessed.\n",
      "The hallmark of HIV infection is progressive but variable rates of systemic and mucosal CD4 depletion, leading to immunodeficiency. The impact of early HIV infection on cervical CD4 T-cell populations in humans remains poorly described.\n",
      "We analyzed cytobrush-derived immune cells by flow cytometry and cytokines in cervicovaginal lavage from participants in early HIV (<6 months postinfection), chronic HIV, and HIV-uninfected controls.\n",
      "CD4:CD8 ratios declined rapidly in both the cervix and the blood following HIV infection. In contrast, absolute cervical CD4 T-cell counts in early HIV were comparable to HIV-uninfected participants, declining only in chronic infection. Early HIV infection was associated with increases in RANTES and MIP3a in cervicovaginal fluids. Concurrently, slight increases in activated cells (CD38HLA-DR) and higher levels of CTLA4 expression on Tregs in the cervix were observed. Although study groups did not differ with respect to levels of CCR5, integrin B7, or CD69, the frequencies of Th17 cells (defined as CCR6CCR10) was reduced by >10-fold in early HIV infection and Th1 cells (defined as CCR6CXCR3) were reduced by >2-fold. Although CCR6CCR10 cells did not differ in HIV receptor expression, these cells produced higher levels of interferon gamma and interleukin 17.\n",
      "These data support the model of initial CD4 T-cell depletion followed by overall T-cell influx in response to infection and concomitant increases in immune activation, inflammation, and regulatory markers.

Primary HIV incidence was determined from initially HIV-uninfected FSWs from the same cohort, and incidence rate ratios were compared.\n",
      "The rate of superinfection in these women (7/85; 3.4/100 person-years) was not significantly different from the rate of primary infection in the same population (3.7/100 person-years; incidence rate ratio = 0.91, P = 0.42). Seven women also entered the study dual-infected (16.5% either dual or superinfected). The women with any presence of dual infection were more likely to report sex work as their only source of income (P = 0.05), and trended to be older and more likely to be widowed (P = 0.07).\n",

      "Individuals in the acute stage of HIV infection (AHI) have an elevated potential to transmit HIV and play a critical role in the growth of the epidemic. Routine identification and counseling of individuals during AHI could decrease transmission behavior during this key period. However, diagnosis of AHI may present challenges distinct from those experienced through diagnosis of established HIV infection. A study was conducted in a public youth clinic outside of Cape Town, South Africa, to identify and counsel individuals with acute stage HIV infection. In-depth interviews were conducted with patients following diagnosis. After counseling, patients were accepting of the testing regimen used to diagnose AHI. They used the knowledge of having been recently infected to identify the source of their infection, but did not retain or place importance on information regarding the increased ability to transmit HIV during the acute stage. Future interventions directed at the reduction of HIV transmission following diagnosis with AHI will need to find ways of making this information more salient, possibly through more culturally meaningful educational approaches.\n",
      "Fourth-generation HIV rapid tests (RTs) claim to detect both p24 antigen (Ag) and HIV antibodies (Ab) for early identification of acute infections, important for targeting prevention and reducing HIV transmission. In a nationally representative household survey in Swaziland, 18,172 adults, age 18 to 49 years, received home-based HIV rapid testing in 2010 and 2011. Of the 18,172 individuals, 5,822 (32.0%) were Ab positive (Ab(+)) by the Determine HIV-1/2 Ab/Ab combo test, and 5,789 (99.4%) of those were confirmed to be reactive in the Uni-Gold test. Determine combo identified 12 individuals as having acute infections (Ag(+)/Ab negative [Ab(-)]); however, none had detectable HIV-1 RNA and 8 of 12 remained HIV negative at their 6-week follow-up visit (4 were lost to follow-up). All RT-nonreactive samples were pooled and tested by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to identify acute infections. NAAT identified 13 (0.1%) of the 12,338 HIV antibody-negative specimens as HIV RNA positive, with RNA levels ranging from 300 to >10,000,000 copies/ml. However, none of them were Ag(+) by Determine combo. Follow-up testing of 12 of the 13 NAAT-positive individuals at 6 months demonstrated 12 seroconversions (1 individual was lost to follow-up). Therefore, the Determine combo test had a sensitivity of 0% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 28) and positive predictive value of 0% for the detection of acute infections. The ability of the 4th-generation Determine combo to detect antigen was very poor in Swaziland. Thus, the Determine combo test does not add any value to the current testing algorithm; rather, it adds additional costs and complexity to HIV diagnosis. The detection of acute HIV infections may need to rely on other testing strategies.\n",
      "Monoclonal antibodies derived from blood plasma cells of acute HIV-1-infected individuals are predominantly targeted to the HIV Env gp41 and cross-reactive with commensal bacteria. To understand this phenomenon, we examined anti-HIV responses in ileum B cells using recombinant antibody technology and probed their relationship to commensal bacteria. The dominant ileum B cell response was to Env gp41. Remarkably, a majority (82%) of the ileum anti-gp41 antibodies cross-reacted with commensal bacteria, and of those, 43% showed non-HIV-1 antigen polyreactivity. Pyrosequencing revealed shared HIV-1 antibody clonal lineages between ileum and blood. Mutated immunoglobulin G antibodies cross-reactive with both Env gp41 and microbiota could also be isolated from the ileum of HIV-1 uninfected individuals. Thus, the gp41 commensal bacterial antigen cross-reactive antibodies originate in the intestine, and the gp41 Env response in HIV-1 infection can be derived from a preinfection memory B cell pool triggered by commensal bacteria that cross-react with Env.\n",
      "Antiretroviral therapy is often initiated too late to impact early HIV-related infant mortality. Earlier treatment requires an earlier diagnosis, and the currently recommended 6-week HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test needs reconsideration. This study aims to identify (1) optimal testing intervals to maximize the number of perinatal HIV infections diagnosed and (2) programmatic issues that impact diagnosis.\n",
      "A mathematical model was developed to simulate antiretroviral prophylaxis uptake and health outcomes in 240,000 HIV-exposed South African infants. The model considered routine early testing with 1 PCR (at birth, 6, 10, or 14 weeks of age) and with 2 PCR tests (at birth and at 6, 10, or 14 weeks of age).\n",
      "A single 6-week test would diagnose the same number of perinatal HIV infections as birth testing (P = 0.92) but fewer infections than a 10-week test (P < 0.01). Ten-week testing identifies the highest number of perinatally infected infants (P < 0.01 compared with a single test at all other ages) but does not save additional life years compared with birth testing (P = 0.27). Performing 2 PCR tests (at birth and 10 weeks) would identify the highest number of perinatal infections (P < 0.01 versus a second 6- or 14-week test). However, 25% of perinatal HIV infections would remain undiagnosed, largely because of failure to return PCR test results to caregivers.\n",
      "Six weeks may no longer be the optimal age to diagnose perinatal HIV infections. Two early PCR tests (at birth and 10 weeks) would likely be the ideal diagnostic algorithm, but must be coupled with improved program coverage.\n",
      "Whereas human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subtype B-infected individuals generally progress to AIDS within 8-10 years, limited data exist for other clades, especially from Africa. We investigated rates of HIV disease progression of clade C-infected South African women.\n",
      "Prospective seroincidence cohorts in KwaZulu-Natal were assessed for acute HIV infection monthly (n = 245) or every 3 months (n = 594) for up to 4 years. Rapid disease progression was defined as CD4 decline to <350 cells/µL by 2 years postinfection. Serial clinical and laboratory assessments were compared using survival analysis and logistic regression models.\n",
      "Sixty-two women were identified at a median of 42 days postinfection (interquartile range, 34-59), contributing 282 person-years of follow-up. Mean CD4 count dropped by 39.6% at 3 months and 46.7% at 6 months postinfection in women with preinfection measurements. CD4 decline to <350 cells/µL occurred in 31%, 44%, and 55% of women at 1, 2, and 3 years postinfection, respectively, and to <500 cells/µL in 69%, 79%, and 81% at equivalent timepoints. Predictors of rapid progression were CD4 count at 3 months postinfection (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-3.28; P = .002), setpoint viral load (HR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.51-9.67; P = .005), and hepatitis B coinfection (HR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.31-15.69; P = .017). Conversely, presence of any of HLAB*1302, B*27, B*57, B*5801, or B*8101 alleles predicted non-rapid progression (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, .05-.74; P = .016).\n",
      "Nearly half of subtype C-infected women progressed to a CD4 count <350 cells/µL within 2 years of infection. Implementing 2013 World Health Organization treatment guidelines (CD4 count <500 cells/µL) would require most individuals to start antiretroviral therapy within 1 year of HIV infection.\n",
      "We have previously shown that HIV-1 superinfected Zambian seroconverters mount low binding and neutralizing antibody responses to their primary HIV-1 infecting virus, which could increase susceptibility to re-infection. Here, we investigated if antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a process by which virus-infected cells are killed, was also reduced. Superinfected individuals exhibited low ADCC activity compared to non-superinfected individuals, but similar levels of CMV-reactive binding antibodies, suggesting superinfected individuals are capable of generating and maintaining virus-specific antibodies.\n",
      "A national ART program was launched in Tanzania in October 2004. Due to the existence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses co-circulating in Tanzania, it is important to monitor rates of drug resistance. The present study determined the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations among ART-naive female bar and hotel workers, a high-risk population for HIV-1 infection in Moshi, Tanzania. A partial HIV-1 pol gene was analyzed by single-genome amplification and sequencing in 45 subjects (622 pol sequences total; median number of sequences per subject, 13; IQR 5-20) in samples collected in 2005. The prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes A1, C, and D, and inter-subtype recombinant viruses, was 36%, 29%, 9% and 27%, respectively. Thirteen different recombination patterns included D/A1/D, C/A1, A1/C/A1, A1/U/A1, C/U/A1, C/A1, U/D/U, D/A1/D, A1/C, A1/C, A2/C/A2, CRF10_CD/C/CRF10_CD and CRF35_AD/A1/CRF35_AD. CRF35_AD was identified in Tanzania for the first time. All recombinant viruses in this study were unique, suggesting ongoing recombination processes among circulating HIV-1 variants. The prevalence of multiple infections in this population was 16% (n = 7). Primary HIV-1 drug resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in three (7%) subjects (K65R plus Y181C; N60D; and V106M). In some subjects, polymorphisms were observed at the RT positions 41, 69, 75, 98, 101, 179, 190, and 215. Secondary mutations associated with NNRTIs were observed at the RT positions 90 (7%) and 138 (6%). In the protease gene, three subjects (7%) had M46I/L mutations. All subjects in this study had HIV-1 subtype-specific natural polymorphisms at positions 36, 69, 89 and 93 that are associated with drug resistance in HIV-1 subtype B. These results suggested that HIV-1 drug resistance mutations and natural polymorphisms existed in this population before the initiation of the national ART program. With increasing use of ARV, these results highlight the importance of drug resistance monitoring in Tanzania.\n",
      "Research in the past two decades has generated unequivocal evidence that host genetic variations substantially account for the heterogeneous outcomes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In particular, genes encoding human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have various alleles, haplotypes, or specific motifs that can dictate the set-point (a relatively steady state) of plasma viral load (VL), although rapid viral evolution driven by innate and acquired immune responses can obscure the long-term relationships between HLA genotypes and HIV-1-related outcomes. In our analyses of VL data from 521 recent HIV-1 seroconverters enrolled from eastern and southern Africa, HLA-A*03:01 was strongly and persistently associated with low VL in women (frequency = 11.3 %, P < 0.0001) but not in men (frequency = 7.7 %, P = 0.66). This novel sex by HLA interaction (P = 0.003, q = 0.090) did not extend to other frequent HLA class I alleles (n = 34), although HLA-C*18:01 also showed a weak association with low VL in women only (frequency = 9.3 %, P = 0.042, q > 0.50). In a reduced multivariable model, age, sex, geography (clinical sites), previously identified HLA factors (HLA-B*18, B*45, B*53, and B*57), and the interaction term for female sex and HLA-A*03:01 collectively explained 17.0 % of the overall variance in geometric mean VL over a 3-year follow-up period (P < 0.0001). Multiple sensitivity analyses of longitudinal and cross-sectional VL data yielded consistent results. These findings can serve as a proof of principle that the gap of \"missing heritability\" in quantitative genetics can be partially bridged by a systematic evaluation of sex-specific associations.\n",
      "Fever is a common complaint in HIV-1 infected adults and may be a presenting sign of acute HIV-1 infection (AHI). We investigated the extent to which HIV-1 infection was considered in the diagnostic evaluation of febrile adults in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) through a systematic review of published literature and guidelines in the period 2003-2014. We also performed a detailed audit of current practice for the evaluation of febrile young adults in coastal Kenya. Our review identified 43 studies investigating the aetiology of fever in adult outpatients in SSA. While the guidelines identified recommend testing for HIV-1 infection, none mentioned AHI. In our audit of current practice at nine health facilities, only 189 out of 1173 (16.1%) patients, aged 18-29 years, were tested for HIV-1. In a detailed record review, only 2 out of 39 (5.1%) young adults seeking care for fever were tested for HIV-1, and the possibility of AHI was not mentioned. Available literature on adult outpatients presenting with fever is heavily focused on diagnosing malaria and guidelines are poorly defined in terms of evaluating aetiologies other than malaria. Current practice in coastal Kenya shows poor uptake of provider-initiated HIV-1 testing and AHI is not currently considered in the differential diagnosis.\n",
      "A number of antibody biomarkers have been developed to distinguish between recent and established Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and used for HIV incidence estimation from cross-sectional specimens. In general, a cut-off value is specified, and estimates of the following parameters are needed: (i) the mean time interval .w/ between seroconversion and reaching that cut-off; (ii) the probability of correctly identifying individuals who became infected in the last w years (sensitivity); and (iii) the probability of correctly identifying individuals who have been infected for more than w years (specificity). We develop two statistical methods to study the distribution of a biomarker and derive a formula for estimating HIV incidence from a cross-sectional survey. Both methods allow handling interval censored data and basically consist of using a generalized mixture model to model the growth of the biomarker as a function of time since infection. The first uses data from all followed-up individuals and allows incidence estimation in the cohort, whereas the second only uses data from seroconverters. We illustrate our methods using repeated measures of the IgG capture BED enzyme immunoassay. Estimates of calibration parameters, that is, mean window period, mean recency period, sensitivity, and specificities obtained from both models are comparable. The formula derived for incidence estimation gives the maximum likelihood estimate of incidence which, for a given window period, depends only on sensitivity and specificity. The optimal choice of the window period is discussed. Numerical simulations suggest that data from seroconverters can provide reasonable estimates of the calibration parameters.\n",
      "Approximately 3.4 million children worldwide are affected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS with more than 90% of them residing in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Health Organization. A significant proportion of the children eligible for treatment with antiretroviral therapy are not currently receiving it. Neurologic manifestations of HIV are common in both adults and children. There is a large spectrum of neurologic conditions that may be caused by the virus; however, early invasion of the central nervous system by the virus, affecting the developing fetal and infant brain, is believed to result in the most common primary HIV-related central nervous system complication, HIV encephalopathy. This article summarizes the spectrum of neuro-HIV in children, focuses on the neurocognitive and behavioral sequelae, reviews the effects of treatment on the primary neurologic effects of the disease, and discusses the specific challenges of identifying and managing these problems in resource-limited contexts, such as those found on the African continent.\n",
      "We analyzed genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among 124 HIV-1 and 19 HIV-2 strains in sera collected in 1986 from patients of the state hospital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1 env gp41 region of 65 sequences characterized 37 (56.9%) as CRF06_cpx strains, 25 (38.5%) as CRF02_AG, 2 (3.1%) as CRF09_cpx, and 1 (1.5%) as subtype A. Similarly, phylogenetic analysis of the protease (PR) gene region of 73 sequences identified 52 (71.2%) as CRF06_cpx, 15 (20.5%) as CRF02_AG, 5 (6.8%) as subtype A, and 1 (1.4%) was a unique strain that clustered along the B/D lineage but basal to the node connecting the two lineages. HIV-2 PR or integrase (INT) groups A (n = 17 [89.5%]) and B (n = 2 [10.5%]) were found in both monotypic (n = 11) and heterotypic HIV-1/HIV-2 (n = 8) infections, with few HIV-2 group B infections. Based on limited available sampling, evidence suggests two recombinant viruses, CRF06_cpx and CRF02_AG, appear to have driven the beginning of the mid-1980s HIV-1 epidemic in Burkina Faso.\n",
      "In late 2009 US guidelines for HIV treatment were revised to recommend the initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) earlier in the course of the disease. We analyzed the life expectancy gains of people infected with HIV between the introduction of cART in 1996 and the 2009 guideline revisions. Compared to people who initiated cART late (defined as having a CD4 cell count of less than 350 per cubic millimeter of blood), those who initiated treatment early (with a CD4 count of 350-500) could expect to live 6.1 years longer, and the earliest initiators (with a CD4 count of more than 500) could expect an extra 9.0 years of life. The total value of life expectancy gains to the early and earliest initiators of treatment was $80 billion, with each life-year valued at $150,000. The value of the survival gains was more than double the increase in drug manufacturers' revenues from early cART initiation. Our results clarify the economic implications of adherence to treatment guidelines.\n",
      "Febrile adults are usually not tested for acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) in Africa. We assessed a strategy to diagnose AHI among young adult patients seeking care.\n",
      "Young adults (<30 years) who met predefined AHI criteria at care seeking, including fever, sexually transmitted disease symptoms, diarrhoea, body pains or multiple partners were referred from five pharmacies and screened at five health facilities. Prevalent HIV-1 was diagnosed by nationally recommended serial rapid HIV-1 testing. Willing HIV-1-negative patients were evaluated for AHI, defined as a positive p24 antigen test, and subsequent seroconversion or RNA detection. Febrile patients evaluated for AHI were also screened for malaria using a rapid test, with PCR confirmation of positives.\n",
      "In 3602 adults seeking care, overall HIV-1 prevalence was 3.9%: 7.6% (68/897) among patients meeting AHI criteria vs. 2.6% (71/2705) among those who did not (P < 0.001). AHI was diagnosed in five of 506 HIV-1-negative or discordant patients who met AHI risk criteria and were completely evaluated [prevalence 1.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-2.3%]. Of these five AHI cases, four were diagnosed among the 241 patients with fever (prevalence 1.7%, 95% CI 0.5-4.2%), vs. one among 265 non-febrile patients (prevalence 0.4%, 95% CI 0.0-2.0%, P = 0.1). Malaria was confirmed by PCR in four (1.7%) of the 241 febrile patients.\n",
      "AHI was as common as confirmed malaria in young febrile adults seeking care. An AHI detection strategy targeting young febrile adults seeking care at pharmacies and health facilities is feasible and should be considered as an HIV-prevention strategy in high-transmission settings.\n",
      "Immune factors determining clinical progression following HIV-1 infection remain unclear. The SPARTAC trial randomized 366 participants in primary HIV infection (PHI) to different short-course therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate how early immune responses in PHI impacted clinical progression in SPARTAC.\n",
      "Participants with PHI recruited to the SPARTAC trial were sampled at enrolment, prior to commencing any therapy. HIV-1-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) ELISpot responses were measured by gamma interferon ELISPOT. Immunological data were associated with baseline covariates and times to clinical progression using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier plots, and Cox models.\n",
      "Making a CD4(+) T-cell ELISpot response (n = 119) at enrolment was associated with higher CD4(+) cell counts (P = 0.02) and to some extent lower plasma HIV RNA (P = 0.07). There was no correlation between the number of overlapping Gag CD8(+) T-cell ELISpot responses (n = 138) and plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years, baseline CD4(+) cell ELISpot responses (n = 119) were associated with slower clinical progression (P = 0.01; log-rank). Over a median of 3.1 years, there was no evidence for a survival advantage imposed by CD8(+) T-cell immunity (P = 0.82).\n",
      "These data support a dominant protective role for CD4(+) T-cell immunity in PHI compared with CD8(+) T-cell responses, and are highly pertinent to HIV pathogenesis and vaccines, indicating that vaccine-induced CD4(+) responses may confer sustained benefit.\n",
      "Acute HIV infection (AHI) is a relatively brief period of time when individuals are highly infectious and the opportunity to intervene to prevent forward transmission is extremely limited. HPTN 062 partnered with CHAVI 001 to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a motivational interviewing (MI)-based counseling intervention to reduce HIV-transmission risk behaviors among individuals with acute and early HIV infection in Lilongwe, Malawi. Participants were randomized to receive either (1) brief education sessions about HIV and AHI; or (2) the same brief education sessions plus an MI-based counseling intervention called Uphungu Wanga. Although Uphungu Wanga was determined to be feasible and acceptable, few major differences existed between the two arms with regard to acceptability, feasibility, and self-reported sexual behaviors. We therefore conclude that an additional MI-based counseling intervention may not be needed during the short period of AHI. Instead, we recommend that individuals with AHI receive frequent, but brief, counseling immediately after diagnosis and then transition to receiving counseling at less frequent intervals until they can initiate antiretroviral therapy. Other recommendations are provided.\n",
      "Co-infection with falciparum malaria and HIV-1 increases the severity and mortality of both infections in unstable malaria-transmission areas. In contrast, in stable transmission areas, HIV co-infection increases the severity of both infections but has not been found to influence malaria mortality.\n",
      "In a prospective cross-sectional study, clinical and laboratory data were consecutively collected for all adults admitted with fever and/or suspected malaria to the medical department of the Central Hospital of Maputo, Mozambique, during two malaria seasons from January 2011. Malaria and HIV PCRs were performed, and risk factors for fatal outcomes were analysed. The impact of HIV on the clinical presentation and mortality of malaria was assessed.\n",
      "A total of 212 non-pregnant adults with fever and/or suspected malaria and 56 healthy controls were included in the study. Of the 131 patients with confirmed falciparum malaria, 70 were co-infected with HIV-1. The in-hospital mortality of the co-infected patients was 13.0% (9/69) compared with 1.7% (1/59) in the patients without HIV (p = 0.018). Malaria severity (p = 0.016) and co-infection with HIV (p = 0.064) were independent risk factors for death although the association with HIV did not reach statistical significance. The co-infected patients had significantly more frequent respiratory distress, bleeding disturbances, hypoglycaemia, liver and renal failure and high malaria parasitemia compared with the patients with malaria alone.\n",
      "HIV co-infection is associated with increased disease severity in and mortality from malaria in an area of stable malaria transmission. This finding was not observed earlier and should motivate doctors working in malaria-endemic areas to consider early HIV testing and a closer follow-up of patients with malaria and HIV co-infection.\n",
      "There has been discussion about whether individuals coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (∼30% of all people living with HIV) should be prioritized for early HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assess the relative benefits of providing ART at CD4 count below 500  cells/μl or immediate ART to HCV/HIV or HBV/HIV-coinfected adults compared with HIV-monoinfected adults. We evaluate individual outcomes (HIV/liver disease progression) and preventive benefits in a generalized HIV epidemic setting.\n",
      "We modeled disease progression for HIV-monoinfected, HBV/HIV-coinfected, and HCV/HIV-coinfected adults for differing ART eligibility thresholds (CD4 <350  cells/μl, CD4 <500  cells/μl, immediate ART eligibility upon infection). We report disability-adjusted life-years averted per 100 person-years on ART (DALYaverted/100PYonART) as a measure of the health benefits generated from incremental changes in ART eligibility. Sensitivity analyses explored impact on sexual HIV and vertical HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission.\n",
      "For HBV/HIV-coinfected adults, a switch to ART initiation at CD4 count below 500  cells/μl from CD4 below 350  cells/μl generates 9% greater health benefits per year on ART (48 DALYaverted/100PYonART) than for HIV-monoinfected adults (44 DALYaverted/100PYonART). Additionally, ART at CD4 below 500  cells/μl could prevent 25% and 32% of vertical transmissions of HIV and HBV, respectively. For HCV/HIV-coinfected adults, ART at CD4 below 500  cells/μl generates 10% fewer health benefits (40 DALYaverted/100PYonART) than for HIV monoinfection, unless ART reduces progression to cirrhosis by more than 70% (33% in base-case).\n",
      "The additional therapeutic benefits of ART for HBV-related liver disease results in ART generating more health benefits among HBV/HIV-coinfected adults than HIV-monoinfected individuals, whereas less health benefits are generated amongst HCV/HIV coinfection in a generalized HIV epidemic setting.\n",
      "Mobile HIV screening may facilitate early HIV diagnosis. Our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness of adding a mobile screening unit to current medical facility-based HIV testing in Cape Town, South Africa.\n",
      "We used the Cost Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications International (CEPAC-I) computer simulation model to evaluate two HIV screening strategies in Cape Town: 1) medical facility-based testing (the current standard of care) and 2) addition of a mobile HIV-testing unit intervention in the same community. Baseline input parameters were derived from a Cape Town-based mobile unit that tested 18,870 individuals over 2 years: prevalence of previously undiagnosed HIV (6.6%), mean CD4 count at diagnosis (males 423/µL, females 516/µL), CD4 count-dependent linkage to care rates (males 31%-58%, females 49%-58%), mobile unit intervention cost (includes acquisition, operation and HIV test costs, $29.30 per negative result and $31.30 per positive result). We conducted extensive sensitivity analyses to evaluate input uncertainty. Model outcomes included site of HIV diagnosis, life expectancy, medical costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention compared to medical facility-based testing. We considered the intervention to be \"very cost-effective\" when the ICER was less than South Africa's annual per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ($8,200 in 2012). We projected that, with medical facility-based testing, the discounted (undiscounted) HIV-infected population life expectancy was 132.2 (197.7) months; this increased to 140.7 (211.7) months with the addition of the mobile unit. The ICER for the mobile unit was $2,400/year of life saved (YLS). Results were most sensitive to the previously undiagnosed HIV prevalence, linkage to care rates, and frequency of HIV testing at medical facilities.\n",
      "The addition of mobile HIV screening to current testing programs can improve survival and be very cost-effective in South Africa and other resource-limited settings, and should be a priority.\n",
      "Given the high prevalence of HIV in South Africa and co-morbid mental disorders in people living with HIV/AIDs (PLWHA) we sought to validate a brief screening tool in primary HIV care.\n",
      "366 PLWHA were recruited prior to combination anti-retroviral treatment (CART) initiation from two primary health HIV clinics. A mental health nurse administered a socio-demographic questionnaire and the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and a lay counsellor administered the Substance and Mental Illness Symptom Screener (SAMISS).\n",
      "Using the MINI, 17 % of participants were identified with either depression, anxiety disorders or adjustment disorder and 18 % with substance or alcohol abuse/dependence. The sensitivity and specificity of the SAMISS was 94 % (95 % CI: 88-98 %) and 58 % (95 % CI: 52-65 %) respectively, with the alcohol component (sensitivity: 94 %; specificity: 85 %) performing better than the mental illness component of the SAMISS (sensitivity: 97 %; specificity: 60 %). The specificity of the tool improved when the cut-off for the mental illness component was increased.\n",
      "The SAMISS may provide a useful first tier screening tool for common mental disorders in primary care for PLWHA.\n",
      "In HIV-1 infection, plasma viral load (VL) has dual implications for pathogenesis and public health. Based on well-known patterns of HIV-1 evolution and immune escape, we hypothesized that VL is an evolving quantitative trait that depends heavily on duration of infection (DOI), demographic features, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and viral characteristics. Prospective data from 421 African seroconverters with at least four eligible visits did show relatively steady VL beyond 3 months of untreated infection, but host and viral factors independently associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal VL often varied by analytical approaches and sliding time windows. Specifically, the effects of age, HLA-B(⁎)53 and infecting HIV-1 subtypes (A1, C and others) on VL were either sporadic or highly sensitive to time windows. These observations were strengthened by the addition of 111 seroconverters with 2-3 eligible VL results, suggesting that DOI should be a critical parameter in epidemiological and clinical studies.\n",
      "High expression of CD161 on CD8+ T cells is associated with a population of cells thought to play a role in mucosal immunity. We wished to investigate this subset in an HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) endemic African setting.\n",
      "A flow cytometric approach was used to assess the frequency and phenotype of CD161++CD8+ T cells. 80 individuals were recruited for cross-sectional analysis: controls (n = 18), latent MTB infection (LTBI) only (n = 16), pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) only (n = 8), HIV only (n = 13), HIV and LTBI co-infection (n = 15) and HIV and TB co-infection (n = 10). The impact of acute HIV infection was assessed in 5 individuals recruited within 3 weeks of infection. The frequency of CD161++CD8+ T cells was assessed prior to and during antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 14 HIV-positive patients.\n",
      "CD161++CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of the HIV co-receptor CCR5, the tissue-homing marker CCR6, and the Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cell TCR Vα7.2. Acute and chronic HIV were associated with lower frequencies of CD161++CD8+ T cells, which did not correlate with CD4 count or HIV viral load. ART was not associated with an increase in CD161++CD8+ T cell frequency. There was a trend towards lower levels of CD161++CD8+ T cells in HIV-negative individuals with active and latent TB. In those co-infected with HIV and TB, CD161++CD8+ T cells were found at low levels similar to those seen in HIV mono-infection.\n",
      "The frequencies and phenotype of CD161++CD8+ T cells in this South African cohort are comparable to those published in European and US cohorts. Low-levels of this population were associated with acute and chronic HIV infection. Lower levels of the tissue-trophic CD161++ CD8+ T cell population may contribute to weakened mucosal immune defense, making HIV-infected subjects more susceptible to pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections and detrimentally impacting on host defense against TB.\n",
      "HIV-1 superinfection (SI) occurs when an infected individual acquires a distinct new viral strain. The rate of superinfection may be reflective of the underlying HIV risk in a population. The Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 004 clinical trial demonstrated that women who used a tenofovir-containing microbicide gel had lower rates of HIV infection than women using a placebo gel. Women who contracted HIV-1 during the trial were screened for the occurrence of superinfection by next-generation sequencing of the viral gag and env genes. There were two cases (one in each trial arm) of subtype C superinfection identified from the 76 women with primary infection screened at two time points (rate of superinfection, 1.5/100 person-years). Both women experienced a >0.5-log increase in viral load during the window when superinfection occurred. The rate of superinfection was significantly lower than the overall primary HIV incidence in the microbicide trial (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.20; P=0.003). The women who seroconverted during the trial reported a significant increase in sexual contact with their stable partner 4 months after seroconversion (P<0.001), which may have lowered the risk of superinfection in this population. The lower frequency of SI compared to the primary incidence is in contrast to a report from a general heterosexual African population but agrees with a study of high-risk women in Kenya. A better understanding of the rate of HIV superinfection could have important implications for ongoing HIV vaccine research.\n",
      "Few studies have investigated the long-term dynamics in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among HIV-positive persons from acute infection. From 2004, 160 women were enrolled into the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection study at two sites in the province of KwaZulu-Natal and underwent 3-6 monthly HRQoL assessments using the functional assessment of HIV infection (FAHI) instrument. Overall and 5 sub-scale FAHI scores [physical well-being (PWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional and global well-being (FGWB), social well-being (SWB) and cognitive functioning (CF)] were calculated up to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and scores at enrollment were compared to the acute, early and established infection phases. Mixed-effects regression models adjusting for behavioral and clinical factors were applied to assess HRQoL trends and the proportion of women meeting minimally important differences was calculated. Our analyses revealed that overall/sub-scale scores improved over time, except from PWB and CF. A higher educational status, contraceptive use and a higher BMI were the strongest predictors of higher overall/sub-scale FAHI scores. CD4 count and HIV viral load were strongly associated with PWB and CF, but not overall FAHI and other sub-scales. Women newly diagnosed with acute HIV infection face profound HRQoL challenges. While early ART delivery may be important for PWB and CF, factors such as education, contraception provision and good nutritional status should be promoted to maximize HRQoL in HIV positive individuals.\n",
      "Blood transfusions carry the risk of transmitting blood-borne infections. In contrast to the situation in the developed world, there is a limited number of studies examining this problem in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study we aimed to calculate the risks of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from units of blood issued by the Gabonese Blood Transfusion Centre between 2009 and 2011.\n",
      "All the donations were tested for infectious diseases and the seroconversion incidence rates of HIV, HBV and HCV were calculated. The residual risk of transfusion-associated transmission for each virus was calculated by multiplying the seroconversion rates by the window period expressed in fractions of a year.\n",
      "The risks of becoming infected with HIV, HCV, and HBV in subjects receiving units of blood from the Gabonese Blood Transfusion Centre were 64.7, 207.94 and 534.53 per million donations, respectively.\n",
      "This study, which is the first to quantify the true risks of transfusion-transmitted infections in Gabon, reveals and confirms the need to reinforce preventative and screening strategies to improve transfusion safety in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Widespread violence followed the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya resulting in the deaths of a reported 1,133 people and the displacement of approximately 660,000 others. At the time of the crisis the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (USAID-AMPATH) Partnership was operating 17 primary HIV clinics in western Kenya and treating 59,437 HIV positive patients (23,437 on antiretroviral therapy (ART)).\n",
      "This case study examines AMPATH's provision of care and maintenance of patients on ART throughout the period of disruption. This was accomplished by implementing immediate interventions including rapid information dissemination through the media, emergency hotlines and community liaisons; organization of a Crisis Response leadership team; the prompt assembly of multidisciplinary teams to address patient care, including psychological support staff (in clinics and in camps for internally displaced persons (IDP)); and the use of the AMPATH Medical Records System to identify patients on ART who had missed clinic appointments.\n",
      "These interventions resulted in the opening of all AMPATH clinics within five days of their scheduled post-holiday opening dates, 23,949 patient visits in January 2008 (23,259 previously scheduled), uninterrupted availability of antiretrovirals at all clinics, treatment of 1,420 HIV patients in IDP camps, distribution of basic provisions, mobilization of outreach services to locate missing AMPATH patients and delivery of psychosocial support to 300 staff members and 632 patients in IDP camps.\n",
      "Key lessons learned in maintaining the delivery of HIV care in a crisis situation include the importance of advance planning to develop programs that can function during a crisis, an emphasis on a rapid programmatic response, the ability of clinics to function autonomously, patient knowledge of their disease, the use of community and patient networks, addressing staff needs and developing effective patient tracking systems.\n",
      "Early HIV testing is critical to prevention and timely treatment. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis can result in unnecessary deaths at a time when access to antiretroviral treatment proves life saving. While HIV prevention and treatment research has increased, less research exists on women's experiences with HIV diagnosis, despite the fact that women are most affected. Insights from local women are critical in designing culturally meaningful interventions that thwart missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis. The purpose of our study was to uncover steps women took to know their HIV diagnosis. Using narrative inquiry methodology informed by post-colonial feminism, we interviewed 40 HIV- positive women in Kenya. Five themes emerged related to uptake of HIV testing for women: (a) spouse's critical illness or death; (b) years of suffering from HIV-related symptoms; (c) sick children; (d) prenatal testing; and (e) personal desire to know one's HIV status. These findings centered on women experiences provide an important basis for health promotion interventions related to HIV prevention, earlier detection, and treatment.\n",
      "The aim of the study was to assess HIV prevalence, disease stage and linkage to HIV care following diagnosis at a mobile HIV testing unit, compared with results for clinic-based testing, in a Durban township.\n",
      "This was a prospective cohort study. We enrolled adults presenting for HIV testing at a community-based mobile testing unit (mobile testers) and at an HIV clinic (clinic testers) serving the same area. Testers diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of testing site, were offered immediate CD4 testing and instructed to retrieve results at the clinic. We assessed rates of linkage to care, defined as CD4 result retrieval within 90 days of HIV diagnosis and/or completion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) literacy training, for mobile vs. clinic testers.\n",
      "From July to November 2011, 6957 subjects were HIV tested (4703 mobile and 2254 clinic); 55% were female. Mobile testers had a lower HIV prevalence than clinic testers (10% vs. 36%, respectively), were younger (median 23 vs. 27 years, respectively) and were more likely to live >5 km or >30 min from the clinic (64% vs. 40%, respectively; all P < 0.001). Mobile testers were less likely to undergo CD4 testing (33% vs. 83%, respectively) but more likely to have higher CD4 counts [median (interquartile range) 416 (287-587) cells/μL vs. 285 (136-482) cells/μL, respectively] than clinic testers (both P < 0.001). Of those who tested HIV positive, 10% of mobile testers linked to care, vs. 72% of clinic testers (P < 0.001).\n",
      "Mobile HIV testing reaches people who are younger, who are more geographically remote, and who have earlier disease compared with clinic-based testing. Fewer mobile testers underwent CD4 testing and linked to HIV care. Enhancing linkage efforts may improve the impact of mobile testing for those with early HIV disease.\n",
      "Among HIV-exposed infants in resource-limited countries, 8-12% are infected postnatally by breastfeeding. However, most of those uninfected at birth remain uninfected over time despite daily exposure to HIV in breast milk. Thus, we assessed the HIV-inhibitory activity of breast milk.\n",
      "We measured cross-clade neutralization in activated PBMC of Ugandan subtype A (92UG031) and D (92UG005) primary HIV by breast milk or purified milk IgG and IgA from 25 HIV-infected Ugandan women. Isotype-specific antigen recognition was resolved by immunoblot. We determined HIV subtype from envelope population sequences in cells from 13 milk samples by PCR.\n",
      "Milk inhibited p24 production by ≥50% (dose-dependent) by subtype A (21/25; 84%) and subtype D (11/25; 44%). IgG consistently reacted with multiple HIV antigens, including gp120/gp41, but IgA primarily recognized p24 alone. Depletion of IgG (n = 5), not IgA, diminished neutralization (mean 78 ± 33%) that was largely restored by IgG repletion. Mothers infected with subtype A more effectively neutralized subtype A than D.\n",
      "Breast milk from HIV-infected women showed homotypic and cross-subtype neutralization of HIV by IgG-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These data direct further investigations into mechanisms of resistance against postnatal transmission of HIV to infants from their mothers.\n",
      "Uganda scaled-up Early HIV Infant Diagnosis (EID) when simplified methods for testing of infants using dried blood spots (DBS) were adopted in 2006 and sample transport and management was therefore made feasible in rural settings. Before this time only 35% of the facilities that were providing EID services were reached through the national postal courier system, Posta Uganda. The transportation of samples during this scale-up, therefore, quickly became a challenge and varied from facility to facility as different methods were used to transport the samples. This study evaluates a novel specimen transport network system for EID testing.\n",
      "A retrospective study was done in mid-2012 on 19 pilot hubs serving 616 health facilities in Uganda. The effect on sample-result turnaround time (TAT) and the cost of DBS sample transport on 876 sample-results was analyzed.\n",
      "The HUB network system provided increased access to EID services ranging from 36% to 51%, drastically reduced transportation costs by 62%, reduced turn-around times by 46.9% and by a further 46.2% through introduction of SMS printers.\n",
      "The HUB model provides a functional, reliable and efficient national referral network against which other health system strengthening initiatives can be built to increase access to critical diagnostic and treatment monitoring services, improve the quality of laboratory and diagnostic services, with reduced turn-around times and improved quality of prevention and treatment programs thereby reducing long-term costs.\n",
      "We prospectively investigated fever symptoms and maternal diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy (MIP) in relation to child HIV infection among 2368 pregnant HIV-positive women and their infants, followed up from pregnancy until 6 weeks post-delivery in Tanzania.\n",
      "Doctors clinically diagnosed and treated MIP and fever symptoms during prenatal health care. Child HIV status was determined via DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by the 6th week of life.\n",
      "Mean gestational age at enrolment was 22.2 weeks. During follow-up, 16.6% of mothers had at least one MIP diagnosis, 15.9% reported fever symptoms and 8.7% had both fever and MIP diagnosis. Eleven per cent of HIV-exposed infants were HIV-positive by 6 weeks. The RR of HIV MTCT was statistically similar for infants whose mothers were ever vs. never clinically diagnosed with MIP (RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.94-1.64), were diagnosed with one vs. no clinical MIP episodes (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.77-1.48) and had ever vs. never reported fever symptoms (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.78-1.38) in pregnancy. However, the HIV MTCT risk increased by 29% (95% CI 4-58%) per MIP episode. Infants of women with at least two vs. no MIP diagnoses were 2.1 times more likely to be HIV infected by 6 weeks old (95% CI 1.31-3.45).\n",
      "Clinical MIP diagnosis, but not fevers, in HIV-positive pregnant women was associated with an elevated risk of early HIV MTCT, suggesting that malaria prevention and treatment in pregnant HIV-positive women may enhance the effectiveness of HIV prevention in MTCT programmes in this setting. Future studies using a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of malaria are needed to confirm this association.\n",
      "Little is known about the differences in clinical manifestations between women with various HIV-1 subtypes during acute (AI) and early (EI) HIV infection. In a longitudinal cohort study, clinical signs and symptoms among Uganda and Zimbabwe women with AI and EI were compared with HIV-negative controls; symptoms were assessed quarterly for 15 to 24 months. Early HIV infection was defined as the first visit during which a woman tested HIV antibody positive. Women who were HIV negative serologically but DNA polymerase chain reaction positive were considered AI. In all, 26 women were classified AI and 192 EI, with 654 HIV-negative controls. Primary HIV infection (AI and EI) was associated with unexplained fever (P <.01), weight loss (P <.01), fatigue (P <.01), inguinal adenopathy (P <.01), and cervical friability (P =.01). More women with subtype C infection had unexplained fever, fatigue, and abnormal vaginal discharge compared to subtype A or D infection. Inguinal adenopathy occurred less often in women with subtype A infection than those with subtype C or D infection.\n",
      "We examined the ability of HIV-1 subtype C to develop resistance to the inhibitory lectins, griffithsin (GRFT), cyanovirin-N (CV-N) and scytovirin (SVN), which bind multiple mannose-rich glycans on gp120. Four primary HIV-1 strains cultured under escalating concentrations of these lectins became increasingly resistant tolerating 2 to 12 times their 50% inhibitory concentrations. Sequence analysis of gp120 showed that most had deletions of 1 to 5 mannose-rich glycans. Glycosylation sites at positions 230, 234, 241, 289 located in the C2 region and 339, 392 and 448 in the C3-C4 region were affected. Furthermore, deletions and insertions of up to 5 amino acids in the V4 region were observed in 3 of the 4 isolates. These data suggest that loss of glycosylation sites on gp120 as well as rearrangement of glycans in V4 are mechanisms involved in HIV-1 subtype C escape from GRFT, CV-N and SVN.\n",
      "Use of antiretroviral-based microbicides for HIV-1 prophylaxis could introduce a transmission barrier that inadvertently facilitates the selection of fitter viral variants among incident infections. To investigate this, we assessed the in vitro function of gag-protease and nef sequences from participants who acquired HIV-1 during the CAPRISA 004 1% tenofovir microbicide gel trial.\n",
      "We isolated the earliest available gag-protease and nef gene sequences from 83 individuals and examined their in vitro function using recombinant viral replication capacity assays and surface protein downregulation assays, respectively. No major phylogenetic clustering and no significant differences in gag-protease or nef function were observed in participants who received tenofovir gel versus placebo gel prophylaxis.\n",
      "Results indicate that the partial protective effects of 1% tenofovir gel use in the CAPRISA 004 trial were not offset by selection of transmitted/early HIV-1 variants with enhanced Gag-Protease or Nef fitness.\n",
      "Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is the most common cause of focal deficits in patients living with HIV/AIDS. Among 257 HIV-infected adult patients seen between January 2006 and December 2010 in a tertiary hospital in Zaria, northern Nigeria, 9 (3.5%) patients had clinical, serological, and brain imaging evidence of TE. All 9 patients had CD4 count of less than 50 cells/mm(3). Of the 9 patients, 7 were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, while 2 were cases of ART-induced TE-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. After administering intravenous dexamethasone for cerebral decompression and specific antitoxoplasma therapy, symptoms and signs resolved in 8 patients within 4 to 14 days, but 1 patient died. Our data suggest that even in the ART era in Nigeria, TE remains a fairly common cause of morbidity among HIV-infected patients due to late HIV diagnosis and significant immunosuppression at diagnosis. Early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of highly active ART, and routine prophylaxis against TE are imperative in combating the challenge of HIV/AIDS-related TE in Nigeria.\n",
      "In Mozambique, highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) was introduced in 2004 followed by decentralization and expansion, resulting in a more than 20-fold increase in coverage by 2009. Implementation of HIV drug resistance threshold surveys (HIVDR-TS) is crucial in order to monitor the emergence of transmitted viral resistance, and to produce evidence-based recommendations to support antiretroviral (ARV) policy in Mozambique.\n",
      "World Health Organization (WHO) methodology was used to evaluate transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics in Maputo and Beira to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI). Subtypes were assigned using REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool and phylogenetic trees constructed using MEGA version 5.\n",
      "Although mutations associated with resistance to all three drug were detected in these surveys, transmitted resistance was analyzed and classified as <5% in Maputo in both surveys for all three drug classes. Transmitted resistance to NNRTI in Beira in 2009 was classified between 5-15%, an increase from 2007 when no NNRTI mutations were found. All sequences clustered with subtype C.\n",
      "Our results show that the epidemic is dominated by subtype C, where the first-line option based on two NRTI and one NNRTI is still effective for treatment of HIV infection, but intermediate levels of TDR found in Beira reinforce the need for constant evaluation with continuing treatment expansion in Mozambique.\n",
      "FDA-approved HIV Antigen/Antibody combo (4th generation) immunoassays (IAs) can identify HIV-1 infections before the Western blot (WB) becomes positive. In the US, increased detection of acute HIV infections has been facilitated by using 4th generation IAs, but there is no FDA-approved 4th generation rapid test (RT). The Alere Determine™ HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo (Determine Combo) RT detects and distinguishes HIV p24 Antigen (Ag) from Antibody (Ab) to HIV-1+HIV-2 and thus has the potential to improve diagnosis of acute HIV infection.\n",
      "To evaluate the ability of Determine Combo RT to detect acute/early HIV-1 infections and HIV-2 antibody in well-characterized plasma specimens.\n",
      "In HIV-1 seroconverters from the US, Determine Combo reactivity was evaluated by performing the 50% cumulative frequency analysis and by comparing with 3rd and 4th generation IAs' reactivity. HIV-2 plasma specimens from Ivory Coast were tested with Determine Combo.\n",
      "The 50% cumulative frequency analysis in 17 seroconverters placed Determine Combo (Ag+/Ab-, Ag+Ab+, Ag-/Ab+) and Ab-component reactivity at 15.5 and 7 days before WB positivity, respectively. In 26 seroconverters, Determine Combo was reactive in 99.0% and 92.5% of 3rd and 4th generation IAs-reactive specimens, respectively. All HIV-2 plasma specimens were Ab-reactive/Ag-non-reactive by Determine Combo.\n",
      "Based on previous results with the same seroconversion panels, combined Ag/Ab reactivity of the Determine Combo appears between FDA-approved 4th and 3rd generation laboratory IAs. These data indicate that this RT could detect HIV-1 infection earlier than other RTs and it performs well in HIV-2 specimens.\n",
      "The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients.\n",
      "We evaluated the University of North Carolina-Malawi Risk Screening Score (UMRSS) for detection of acute and early HIV-1 infection (AEHI) in a cohort of Kenyan MSM with approximately 8% annual HIV-1 incidence. Three components of the UMRSS (fever, diarrhea, and discordant rapid HIV tests) were also independent predictors of AEHI in our cohort. The predictive ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) of the UMRSS was 0.79. A cohort-derived risk score consisting of six characteristics (fever, diarrhea, discordant rapid HIV tests, fatigue, age <30 years, and symptomatic sexually transmitted disease) had a higher AUC of 0.85. Screening for AEHI will have substantial transmission prevention benefits.\n",
      "To examine age differences in mortality and programme attrition amongst paediatric patients treated in four African HIV programmes.\n",
      "Longitudinal analysis of data from patients enrolled in HIV care. Two-year mortality and programme attrition rates per 1000 person-years stratified by age group (<2, 2-4 and 5-15 years) were calculated. Associations between outcomes and age and other individual-level factors were studied using multiple Cox proportional hazards (mortality) and Poisson (attrition) regression models.\n",
      "Six thousand two hundred and sixty-one patients contributed 9500 person-years; 27.1% were aged <2 years, 30.1% were 2-4, and 42.8% were 5-14 years old. At programme entry, 45.3% were underweight and 12.6% were in clinical stage 4. The highest mortality and attrition rates (98.85 and 244.00 per 1000 person-years), and relative ratios (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.92, 95% CI 1.56-2.37; incidence ratio [aIR] = 2.10, 95% CI 1.86-2.37, respectively, compared with the 5- to 14-year group) were observed amongst the youngest children. Increased mortality and attrition were also associated with advanced clinical stage, underweight and diagnosis of tuberculosis at programme entry.\n",
      "These results highlight the need to increase access, diagnose and provide early HIV care and to accelerate antiretroviral treatment initiation for those eligible. Adapted education and support for children and their families would also be important.\n",
      "Twenty-one blood organizations from five geographical regions provided HIV individual donation (ID)-NAT and serology data on 11,787,610 donations. Infections were classified as anti-HIV-/RNA+ window period (WP), anti-HIV+/RNA+ concordant positive (CP) or anti-HIV+/RNA- elite controller (EC). Residual risk and efficacy of several screening scenarios were estimated for first time, lapsed and repeat donations.\n",
      "WP residual risk estimates assumed a 50% infectious dose of 3.16 virions and a 50% detection limit of 2.7 HIV RNA copies/mL for ID-NAT and 10,000 copies/mL for p24Ag. Infectivity for CP (100%) and EC (2.2%) donations was estimated based on viral load distributions and 100-fold reduced infectivity by antibody neutralization as reported elsewhere. Efficacy was calculated as proportion of transmission risk removed from baseline (i.e. in absence of any screening).\n",
      "There was no significant difference in transmission risk between lapsed and repeat donations in any region. Risk was 3.8-fold higher in first time than combined lapsed/repeat donations in South Africa but not in other regions. Screening strategies were most efficacious at interdicting infectious transfusions in first time (98.7-99.8%) followed by lapsed (97.6-99.7%) and repeat (86.8-97.7%) donations in all regions combined. In each donor category the efficacy of ID-NAT alone (97.7-99.8%) was superior to that of minipool (MP)-NAT/anti-HIV (95.0-99.6%) and p24 Ag/anti-HIV (89.8-99.1%).\n",
      "Efficacy patterns were similar by donor/donation status in each region despite large differences in HIV prevalence and transmission risk. As similar data become available for HBV and HCV, this modeling may be useful in cost effectiveness analyses of alternative testing scenarios.\n",

      "early HIV infection and LPNT.\n",
      "We included 285 infants for analysis; 89.5 % of mothers were receiving ART or pARV; 86% babies took daily pARV (median duration, 6 weeks). Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rate: 96% (median duration, 4 months). The cumulative transmission of HIV-1 was 2.8% at 8 weeks (95% confidence interval: 1.9-3.7). After weaning (abrupt 44%), 3 of 212 infants were HIV infected (1.4%). Nine-month cumulative HIV-transmission rate was 4.2% (1.5-6.9). Incidence of late postnatal HIV infection stood at 1.5/100 child-years of breastfeeding (BF). Cumulative risk of HIV transmission (8 weeks-9 months) was 1%.\n",
      "Both promotion of EBF and access to antiretroviral therapy contribute to lower HIV transmission in breastfed infants in low resource settings.\n",
      "Prompt diagnosis of acute HIV infection (AHI) benefits the individual and provides opportunities for public health intervention. The aim of this study was to describe most common signs and symptoms of AHI, correlate these with early disease progression and develop a clinical algorithm to identify acute HIV cases in resource limited setting.\n",
      "245 South African women at high-risk of HIV-1 were assessed for AHI and received monthly HIV-1 antibody and RNA testing. Signs and symptoms at first HIV-positive visit were compared to HIV-negative visits. Logistic regression identified clinical predictors of AHI. A model-based score was assigned to each predictor to create a risk score for every woman.\n",
      "Twenty-eight women seroconverted after a total of 390 person-years of follow-up with an HIV incidence of 7.2/100 person-years (95%CI 4.5-9.8). Fifty-seven percent reported ≥1 sign or symptom at the AHI visit. Factors predictive of AHI included age <25 years (OR = 3.2; 1.4-7.1), rash (OR = 6.1; 2.4-15.4), sore throat (OR = 2.7; 1.0-7.6), weight loss (OR = 4.4; 1.5-13.4), genital ulcers (OR = 8.0; 1.6-39.5) and vaginal discharge (OR = 5.4; 1.6-18.4). A risk score of 2 correctly predicted AHI in 50.0% of cases. The number of signs and symptoms correlated with higher HIV-1 RNA at diagnosis (r = 0.63; p<0.001).\n",
      "Accurate recognition of signs and symptoms of AHI is critical for early diagnosis of HIV infection. Our algorithm may assist in risk-stratifying individuals for AHI, especially in resource-limited settings where there is no routine testing for AHI. Independent validation of the algorithm on another cohort is needed to assess its utility further. Point-of-care antigen or viral load technology is required, however, to detect asymptomatic, antibody negative cases enabling early interventions and prevention of transmission.\n",
      "General HIV-related orofacial lesions, most commonly oropharyngeal candidiasis, have a typical clinical appearance and can be recognised by members of the community. Although affected patients often experience pain leading to compromised eating and swallowing, barriers such as social stigma and lack of knowledge regarding available services may prevent them from seeking early care. Educating the community about these lesions through community health workers (CHWs) who are democratically elected community members may encourage individuals affected to seek early oral healthcare in the health facilities. A health facility (HF) is a health centre mainly run by clinical officers (CO), i.e. personnel with a 3-year medical training, and nurses. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a CHW training programme on: i) their knowledge and recognition of HIV-related oral-facial lesions at a community level; and ii) referral of affected patients from the community to the HFs.\n",
      "All 800 CHWs in 2 administrative divisions of Nairobi East District (test group n=400; control group n=400) will be selected. The test group will receive training. CHWs in both groups will be assessed at 4 time points: -3, 0, +3 and +6 months with reference to the training on: i) their knowledge of HIV-related orofacial lesions (using a written questionnaire); and ii) their performance in referring affected patients to the HFs (using clinical data).\n",
      "Early recognition of HIV-related orofacial lesions at a community level will prompt community members to seek early oral care, leading to early HIV testing and counselling regarding failure of antiretroviral therapy, while treatment outcomes are still favourable.\n",
      "Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy depends on an early infant diagnosis and is critical to reduce HIV-related infant mortality. We describe the implementation of a routine prevention of mother-to-child transmission program and focus on early infant diagnosis to identify opportunities to improve outcomes.\n",
      "HIV-exposed infants and their mothers were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study at a routine, hospital-based prevention of mother-to-child transmission and HIV treatment service in Johannesburg, South Africa. Infant HIV status was determined by testing samples collected between birth and 6 weeks and searching the national laboratory information system for polymerase chain reaction results of defaulting infants who accessed testing elsewhere.\n",
      "Of 838 enrolled infants, HIV status was determined for 606 (72.3%) by testing at the study site, 85 (10.1%) by accessing test results from other facilities, 19 (2.3%) by testing stored samples and remained unknown in 128 (15.3%) infants. In total, 38 perinatally HIV-infected infants were identified. Thirty (79%) HIV-infected infants accessed 6-week testing and initiated antiretroviral therapy at a median age of 16.0 weeks, but only 14 were in care a median of 68 weeks later and 4 had died. Eight (21%) HIV-infected infants, 2 of whom died, escaped identification by routine testing. Their mothers were younger, more likely to be foreign and accessed less optimal antenatal care.\n",
      "Six-week testing delayed antiretroviral therapy initiation beyond the time of early HIV-related infant mortality and missed one-fifth of perinatally HIV-infected infants. Earlier diagnosis and improved retention in care are required to reduce infant mortality and accurately measure elimination of mother-to-child transmission.\n",
      "New approaches to expanding HIV testing and effective treatment and the wider availability of rapid testing technology have created new opportunities for achieving national and global HIV testing goals. In spite of HIV testing expansion in many settings, growing evidence of the prevention benefits of HIV testing, and the development of new, cost-effective approaches to HIV testing service provision, formidable obstacles to HIV testing expansion persist. Inequitable testing coverage exists within and across countries. While the proportion of people with HIV aware of their status is about 80% in the U.S., the majority of HIV-infected persons in Africa are unaware of their status. Testing of most-at-risk populations, couples, children, and adolescents pose still unresolved policy and programmatic challenges. Future directions for HIV testing include rapid testing technology and detection of acute HIV infection, self-testing expansion, and partner notification. Expanded routine HIV screening and widespread testing is a public health imperative to reach national and international HIV prevention and treatment goals.\n",
      "HIV-1 nucleotide substitution rates are central for understanding the evolution of HIV-1. Their accurate estimation is critical for analysis of viral dynamics, identification of divergence time of HIV variants, inference of HIV transmission clusters, and modeling of viral evolution.\n",
      "Intra-patient nucleotide substitution rates in HIV-1C gag and env gp120 V1C5 were analyzed in a longitudinal cohort of 32 individuals infected with a single viral variant. Viral quasispecies were derived by single genome amplification/sequencing from serially sampled blood specimens collected at median (IQR) of 5 (4-6) times per subject from enrollment (during Fiebig stages II to V) over a median (IQR) of 417 (351-471) days post-seroconversion (p/s). HIV-1C evolutionary rates were estimated by BEAST v.1.7 using a relaxed lognormal molecular clock model. The effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on substitution rates in gag and env was assessed in a subset of six individuals who started ARV therapy during the follow-up period.\n",
      "During primary HIV-1C infection, the intra-patient substitution rates were estimated at a median (IQR) of 5.22E-03 (3.28E-03-7.55E-03) substitutions per site per year of infection within gag, and 1.58E-02 (9.99E-03-2.04E-02) substitutions per site per year within env gp120 V1C5. The substitution rates in env gp120 V1C5 were higher than in gag (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The median (IQR) relative rates of evolution at codon positions 1, 2, and 3 were 0.73 (0.48-0.84), 0.67 (0.52-0.86), and 1.54 (1.21-1.71) in gag, and 1.01 (0.86-1.15), 1.05 (0.99-1.21), and 0.86 (0.67-0.94) in env gp120 V1C5, respectively. A first to the third position codon rate ratio >1.0 within env was found in 25 (78.1%) cases, but only in 4 (12.5%) cases in gag, while a second to the third position codon rate ratio >1.0 in env was observed in 26 (81.3%) cases, but in gag only in 2 (6.3%) cases (p<0.001 for both comparisons, Fisher's exact test). No ART effect on substitution rates in gag and env was found, at least within the first 3-4 months after ART initiation. Individuals with early viral set point ⩾4.0 log10 copies/ml had higher substitution rates in env gp120 V1C5 (median (IQR) 1.88E-02 (1.54E-02-2.46E-02) vs. 1.04E (7.24E-03-1.55E-02) substitutions per site per year; p=0.017, Mann-Whitney sum rank test), while individuals with early viral set point ⩾3.0 log10 copies/ml had higher substitution rates in gag (median (IQR) 5.66E-03 (3.45E-03-7.94E-03) vs. 1.78E-03 (4.57E-04-5.15E-03); p=0.028; Mann-Whitney sum rank test).\n",
      "The results suggest that in primary HIV-1C infection, (1) intra-host evolutionary rates in env gp120 V1C5 are about 3-fold higher than in gag; (2) selection pressure in env is more frequent than in gag; (3) initiation of ART does not change substitution rates in HIV-1C env or gag, at least within the first 3-4 months after starting ART; and (4) intra-host evolutionary rates in gag and env gp120 V1C5 are higher in individuals with elevated levels of early viral set point.\n",
      "HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) is common in South Africa. The optimal time for initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in co-infected patients is a clinical challenge. AIM. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with HIV-associated TB who commenced ART at different stages of TB therapy.\n",
      "A retrospective chart review was conducted of 458 patients who initiated ART at ≤ 28 days (immediate), 29 - 56 days (early) and ≥57 days (delayed) after commencing TB therapy, and clinical outcomes after 6 months of ART were compared.\n",
      "There was a higher mortality in the immediate group, although this was not significant. Renal impairment (hazard ratio (HR) 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 - 4.9; p=0.004) and inpatient ART initiation (HR 3.7; 95% CI 1.6 - 8.2; p=0.001) were risk factors for HIV-associated TB mortality. A baseline haemoglobin concentration ≥10 g/dl (HR 0.2; 95% CI 0.1 - 0.6; p=0.003), extrapulmonary as opposed to pulmonary TB (PTB) (HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1 - 0.7; p=0.005) and extrapulmonary plus PTB as opposed to PTB (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 - 0.6; p=0.002) were significantly associated with decreased mortality.\n",
      "The timing of initiation of ART after commencing TB therapy was not significantly associated with increased mortality or survival. Patients with more advanced disease were more likely to die. Early HIV testing and ART initiation is recommended to decrease mortality.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a mediator of viral transcription and is involved in the control of virus replication. However, associations between HIV-1 Tat diversity and functional effects during primary HIV-1 infection are still unclear. We estimated selection pressures in tat exon 1 using the mixed-effects model of evolution with 672 viral sequences generated from 20 patients infected with HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) over 500 days postseroconversion. tat exon 1 residues 3, 4, 21, 24, 29, 39, and 68 were under positive selection, and we established that specific amino acid signature patterns were apparent in primary HIV-1C infection compared with chronic infection. We assessed the impact of these mutations on long terminal repeat (LTR) activity and found that Tat activity was negatively affected by the Ala(21) substitution identified in 13/20 (65%) of patients, which reduced LTR activity by 88% (± 1%) (P < 0.001). The greatest increase in Tat activity was seen with the Gln(35)/Lys(39) double mutant that resulted in an additional 49% (± 14%) production of LTR-driven luciferase (P = 0.012). There was a moderate positive correlation between Tat-mediated LTR activity and HIV-1 RNA in plasma (P = 0.026; r = 0.400) after 180 days postseroconversion that was reduced by 500 days postseroconversion (P = 0.043; r = 0.266). Although Tat activation of the LTR is not a strong predictor of these clinical variables, there are significant linear relationships between Tat transactivation and patients' plasma viral loads and CD4 counts, highlighting the complex interplay between Tat mutations in early HIV-1C infection.\n",
      "After 3 years of individual-donation nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) screening by the South African National Blood Service (SANBS), a repository of 73 human immunodeficiency virus antibody (anti-HIV)-negative window period (WP)-yield samples and 28 anti-HIV-positive, HIV-RNA-negative elite controllers (ECs) became available for comparison of a p24 antigen (p24 Ag) assay (Innogenetics), two viral load assays (Siemens branch DNA [bDNA] 3.0 and Abbott real-time polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]), and three triplex NAT assays (Novartis Diagnostics Ultrio and Ultrio-Plus and Roche TaqScreen) by replicate testing of dilutions.\n",
      "Viral loads were assessed by bDNA and RT-PCR assays and if below 100 copies (cps)/mL, by Ultrio limiting dilution probit analysis. The probability of virus transmission by WP and EC donations was estimated for different levels of the 50% minimum infectious dose (ID50 ) using Poisson distribution statistics.\n",
      "The equal distribution of WP donations plotted by log HIV-RNA levels indicated a random appearance of donors in the ramp-up phase. The HIV p24 Ag assay detected 45% of WP samples and the cutoff crossing point was estimated at 8140 (bDNA)/22,710 (RT-PCR) cps/mL. On replicate retesting of 40 HIV p24 Ag-negative ID-NAT WP-yield samples Ultrio minipool (MP)8, Ultrio-Plus MP8, and TaqScreen MP6 detected 79, 81, and 78%, respectively. Modeling with an estimated ID50 of 31.6 virions/RBC indicated that 15% of p24 Ag-negative ID-NAT WP-yield donations would have transmitted HIV if MP6-8 NAT had been used. Only 2% of RBC transfusions from ECs are estimated to be infectious with a worst-case ID50 estimate of 316 virions.\n",
      "Our analysis of viremia and infectivity of WP and EC donations enables comparison of the efficacy of NAT options in preventing HIV transmission risk.\n",
      "Opt-out HIV testing is offered at 70% of antenatal care (ANC) clinics in Mozambique through the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) program. If routine data from this program were of sufficient quality, their heightened coverage and continuous availability could complement or even replace biannual sentinel serosurveys that currently serve as the primary HIV surveillance system in Mozambique.\n",
      "We assessed the efficacy of routine HIV testing data from prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs for estimating the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women. The PMTCT program uses sequential point-of-care rapid tests conducted on site while ANC surveillance surveys use dried blood spots tested sequentially for HIV-1/2 antibodies at a central laboratory. We compared matched routine PMTCT and ANC surveillance test results collected during 2007 and 2009 ANC surveillance surveys from 36 sentinel sites.\n",
      "After excluding 659 women without PMTCT data, including 83 who refused rapid testing, test results from a total of 20,563 women were available. Pooling the data from both years indicated HIV prevalence from routine PMTCT testing was 14.4% versus 15.2% from surveillance testing (relative difference -5.1%; absolute difference -0.78%). Positive percent agreement (PPA) of PMTCT versus surveillance tests was 88.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 85.7-91.3%), with 19 sites having PPA below 90%; Negative percent agreement (NPA) was 98.9% (CI: 98.5-99.2%). No significant difference was found among three regions (North, Center and South), however both PPA and NPA were significantly higher in 2009 than 2007 (p < 0.05).\n",
      "We found low PPA of PMTCT test results compared to surveillance data which is indicative either of testing errors or data reporting problems. Nonetheless, PPA improved significantly from 2007 to 2009, a possible positive trend that should be investigated further. Although use of PMTCT test results would not dramatically change HIV prevalence estimates among pregnant women, the impact of site-level differences on surveillance models should be evaluated before these data are used to replace or complement ANC surveillance surveys.\n",
      "The global epidemiology of HIV/AIDS is rapidly evolving in low and middle income countries. Women and adolescent females in Sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of HIV acquisition due to a myriad of complex biological, behavioral and structural factors. Primary HIV infection among women primarily drives the pediatric HIV epidemic. Postnatal transmission of HIV during breastfeeding is a major concern in LMIC, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where breastfeeding remains the only feasible, safe and culturally acceptable infant feeding choice. Given the remarkable discoveries in biomedical interventions to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and MTCT during breastfeeding, there is now a unique opportunity to rapidly implement combination HIV prevention packages, provide quality prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services, and improve maternal and infant survival. Although rapid scale-up of PMTCT interventions has occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa in the past five years, significant challenges remain towards reaching the ambitious goal of virtual elimination of new HIV infections among children on a global scale by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive. Rapid translation of scientific discoveries into policy and practice in conjunction with strong commitment from national leadership and global partners is crucial to end the pediatric AIDS and achieve a HIV-free generation.\n",
      "To estimate the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening strategies for the prevention of perinatal transmission in Uganda, a resource-limited country with high HIV prevalence and incidence.\n",
      "We designed a decision analytic model from a health care system perspective to assess the vertical transmission rates and cost-effectiveness of 4 different HIV screening strategies in pregnancy: (1) rapid HIV antibody (Ab) test at initial visit (current standard of care), (2) strategy 1 + HIV RNA at initial visit (adds detection of acute HIV), (3) strategy 1 + repeat HIV Ab at delivery (adds detection of incident HIV), and (4) strategy 3 + HIV RNA at delivery (adds detection of acute HIV at delivery). Model estimates were derived from the literature and local sources, and life years saved were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Based on World Health Organization guidelines, we defined our cost-effectiveness threshold as ≤3 times the gross domestic product per capita, which for Uganda was US$3300 in 2008.\n",
      "Using base case estimates of 10% HIV prevalence among women entering prenatal care and 3% incidence during pregnancy, strategy 3 was incrementally the cost-effective option that led to the greatest total life years.\n",
      "Repeat rapid HIV Ab testing at the time of labor is a cost-effective strategy even in a resource-limited setting such as Uganda.\n",
      "Assays that detect p24 antigen reduce the diagnostic window period of HIV testing. Most point-of-care HIV assays have poor sensitivity to diagnose acute HIV infection as they only detect antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 (HIV-1/2). This was a cross-sectional laboratory-based study that evaluated the performance of the Determine™ HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo fourth generation rapid strip - currently the only rapid assay that detects both HIV-1/2 antibodies and p24 antigen. A total of 79 serum specimens (29 positive for HIV antibodies only, 14 positive for HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, 20 HIV-negative, and 16 positive for p24 antigen only) were used for the evaluation. Results were compared with those from validated fourth generation HIV ELISAs. The Determine™ Combo rapid strips had a sensitivity of 90.7% and a specificity of 100% for the detection of HIV-1/2 antibodies. Its sensitivity for the detection of p24 antigen was only 10% (3 out of 30 p24 antigen positive specimens). This implies that most acute HIV infections will be missed with this assay. The need for a point-of-care assay which can detect acute HIV infection reliably still remains, particularly for use in a high prevalence setting such as South Africa.\n",
      "Efforts to expand access to HIV care and treatment often stress the importance of disclosure of HIV status to aid adherence, social support, and continued resource mobilization. We argue that an examination of disclosure processes early in the process of seeking testing and treatment can illuminate individual decisions and motivations, offering insight into potentially improving engagement in care and adherence. We report on baseline data of early HIV disclosure and nondisclosure, including reasons for and responses to disclosure from a cohort of men and women (n=949) currently accessing antiretroviral treatment in two regions of Uganda. We found early disclosures at the time of suspicion or testing positive for HIV by men and women to be largely for the purposes of emotional support and friendship. Responses to these selected disclosures were overwhelmingly positive and supportive, including assistance in accessing treatment. Nonetheless, some negative responses of worry, fear, or social ostracism did occur. Individuals deliberately chose to not disclose their status to partners, relatives, and others in their network, for reasons of privacy or not wanting to cause worry from the other person. These data demonstrate the strategic choices that individuals make early in the course of suspicion, testing, and treatment for HIV to mobilize resources and gain emotional or material support, and similarly their decisions and ability to maintain privacy regarding their status.\n",
      "Recent reports suggest that Natural Killer (NK) cells may modulate pathogenesis of primary HIV-1 infection. However, HIV dysregulates NK-cell responses. We dissected this bi-directional relationship to understand how HIV impacts NK-cell responses during primary HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "Paired samples from 41 high-risk, initially HIV-uninfected CAPRISA004 participants were analysed prior to HIV acquisition, and during viraemic primary HIV-1 infection. At the time of sampling post-infection five women were seronegative, 11 women were serodiscordant, and 25 women were seropositive by HIV-1 rapid immunoassay. Flow cytometry was used to measure NK and T-cell activation, NK-cell receptor expression, cytotoxic and cytokine-secretory functions, and trafficking marker expression (CCR7, α(4)β(7)). Non-parametric statistical tests were used. Both NK cells and T-cells were significantly activated following HIV acquisition (p = 0.03 and p<0.0001, respectively), but correlation between NK-cell and T-cell activation was uncoupled following infection (pre-infection r = 0.68;p<0.0001; post-infection, during primary infection r = 0.074;p = 0.09). Nonetheless, during primary infection NK-cell and T-cell activation correlated with HIV viral load (r = 0.32'p = 0.04 and r = 0.35;p = 0.02, respectively). The frequency of Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor-expressing (KIR(pos)) NK cells increased following HIV acquisition (p = 0.006), and KIR(pos) NK cells were less activated than KIR(neg) NK cells amongst individuals sampled while seronegative or serodiscordant (p = 0.001;p<0.0001 respectively). During HIV-1 infection, cytotoxic NK cell responses evaluated after IL-2 stimulation alone, or after co-culture with 721 cells, were impaired (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002, respectively). However, NK-cell IFN-y secretory function was not significantly altered. The frequency of CCR7+ NK cells was elevated during primary infection, particularly at early time-points (p<0.0001).\n",
      "Analyses of immune cells before and after HIV infection revealed an increase in both NK-cell activation and KIR expression, but reduced cytotoxicity during acute infection. The increase in frequency of NK cells able to traffic to lymph nodes following HIV infection suggests that these cells may play a role in events in secondary lymphoid tissue.\n",
      "Recent data suggest that infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C results in prolonged high-level viremia (>5 log10 copies/mL) during early infection. We examined the relationship between HIV-1 subtype and plasma viremia among 153 African seroconverters. Mean setpoint viral loads were similar for C and non-C subtypes: 4.36 vs 4.42 log10 copies/mL (P = .61). The proportion of subtype C-infected participants with viral loads >5 log10 copies/mL was not greater than the proportion for those with non-C infection. Our data do not support the hypothesis that higher early viral load accounts for the rapid spread of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa.\n",
      "A vaccine capable of providing cross-clade, sterilizing protection has been the holy grail of HIV-1 prevention and control since the beginning of the pandemic. A major component of this effort has been the identification and characterization of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Recent advances in bNAb isolation, structure-based engineering, and vector-mediated gene transfer have led to increased interest in bypassing the immune system by expressing neutralizing antibodies directly in muscle. To assess the neutralization potency and coverage of a panel of second-generation bNAbs, we cloned and phenotypically characterized 227 primary HIV-1 envelopes from 23 mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) pairs.\n",
      "Viral envelopes were tested for in-vitro neutralization sensitivity using a standard pseudotype assay system. A 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) at least 10 μg/ml was used to define neutralization resistance.\n",
      "The combination of antibodies PG16 and NIH45-46 had the broadest activity with the highest neutralization potency, achieving full coverage of 87% of transmission pairs (at a median sampling depth of 10 envelopes per pair) and 96% of recently infected infants in a very conservative analysis.\n",
      "Our data strongly support the inclusion of NIH45-46, or a more extensively modified variant, in future proof-of-principle immunoprophylaxis or gene therapy-based trials. Furthermore, until robust sequence-based resistance detection becomes available, it will be necessary to conduct deeper phenotypic screening of primary isolates in order to determine the prevalence of minor resistant variants to help in selecting the best reagents for clinical trials.\n",
      "Early HIV testing and diagnosis are paramount for increasing treatment initiation among children, necessary for their survival and improved health. However, uptake of pediatric HIV testing is low in high-prevalence areas. We present data on attitudes towards pediatric testing from a nationally representative survey in Zimbabwe.\n",
      "All 18-24 year olds and a proportion of 25-49 year olds living in randomly selected enumeration areas from all ten Zimbabwe provinces were invited to self-complete an anonymous questionnaire on a personal digital assistant, and 16,719 people agreed to participate (75% of eligibles).\n",
      "Most people think children can benefit from HIV testing (91%), 81% of people who looked after children know how to access testing for their children and 92% would feel happier if their children were tested. Notably, 42% fear that, if tested, children may be discriminated against by some community members and 28% fear their children are HIV positive. People who fear discrimination against children who have tested for HIV are more likely than their counterparts to perceive their community as stigmatizing against HIV positive people (43% vs. 29%). They are also less likely to report positive attitudes to HIV themselves (49% vs. 74%). Only 28% think it is possible for children HIV-infected at birth to live into adolescence without treatment. Approximately 70% of people (irrespective of whether they are themselves parents) think HIV-infected children in their communities can access testing and treatment.\n",
      "Pediatric HIV testing is the essential gateway to prevention and care services. Our data indicate positive attitudes to testing children, suggesting a conducive environment for increasing uptake of pediatric testing in Zimbabwe. However, there is a need to better understand the barriers to pediatric testing, such as stigma and discrimination, and address the gaps in knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS in children.\n",
      "The fight against HIV remains complicated with contracting donor resources and high burden of HIV among reproductive age adults still often limiting independent economic development. In the widespread HIV epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is proposed that key populations with specific HIV acquisition and transmission risk factors, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), and people who use drugs (PUD), are less relevant because HIV transmission is sustained in the general population with average HIV acquisition and transmission risks. However, the understanding that key populations are less relevant in the epidemics of Africa is based on the surveillance system from which these populations are mostly excluded. Outside of SSA, the epidemics of HIV are generally concentrated in the same populations that are excluded from the primary HIV surveillance systems in SSA. The manuscripts included in this special issue present convincing data that FSW, MSM, and PUD carry disproportionate burdens of HIV wherever studied in SSA, are underrepresented in HIV programs and research, and require specific HIV prevention services. These manuscripts collectively suggest that the only effective path forward is one that transcends denial and stigma and focuses on systematically collecting data on all populations at risk for HIV. In addition, there is a need to move to a third generation of HIV surveillance as the current one inadvertently devalues HIV surveillance among key populations in the context of widespread HIV epidemics. Overall, the data reviewed here demonstrate that the dynamics of HIV in Africa are complex and achieving an AIDS-free generation necessitates acceptance of that complexity in all HIV surveillance, research, and prevention, treatment, and care programs.\n",
      "West Central Africa has been implicated as the epicenter of the HIV-1 epidemic, and almost all group M subtypes can be found there. Previous analysis of early HIV-1 group M sequences from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, revealed that isolates from a number of individuals fall in different positions in phylogenetic trees constructed from sequences from opposite ends of the genome as a result of recombination between viruses of different subtypes. Here, we use discrete ancestral trait mapping to develop a procedure for quantifying HIV-1 group M intersubtype recombination across phylogenies, using individuals' gag (p17) and env (gp41) subtypes. The method was applied to previously described HIV-1 group M sequences from samples obtained in Kinshasa early in the global radiation of HIV. Nine different p17 and gp41 intersubtype recombinant combinations were present in the data set. The mean number of excess ancestral subtype transitions (NEST) required to map individuals' p17 subtypes onto the gp14 phylogeny samples, compared to the number required to map them onto the p17 phylogenies, and vice versa, indicated that excess subtype transitions occurred at a rate of approximately 7 × 10(-3) to 8 × 10(-3) per lineage per year as a result of intersubtype recombination. Our results imply that intersubtype recombination may have occurred in approximately 20% of lineages evolving over a period of 30 years and confirm intersubtype recombination as a substantial force in generating HIV-1 group M diversity.\n",
      "A new host-pathogen model is described that simulates HIV-MTB co-infection and treatment, with the objective of testing treatment strategies. The model includes CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resting and activated macrophages, HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). For TB presentation at various stages of HIV disease in a co-infected individual, combined treatment strategies were tested with different relative timings of treatment for each infection. The stages were early HIV disease, late HIV disease and AIDS. The main strategies were TB treatment followed by anti-retroviral therapy (ART) after delays of 15 days, 2 months and 6 months. ART followed by TB treatment was an additional strategy that was tested. Treatment was simulated with and without drug interaction. Simulation results were that TB treatment first followed by ART after a stage-dependent delay has the best outcome. During early HIV disease a 6 month delay is acceptable. During late HIV disease, a 2 month delay is best. During AIDS it is better to start ART after 15 days. However, drug interaction works against the benefits of early ART. These results agree with expert reviews and clinical trials.\n",
      "Initial studies of 88 transmission pairs in the Zambia Emory HIV Research Project cohort demonstrated that the number of transmitted HLA-B associated polymorphisms in Gag, but not Nef, was negatively correlated to set point viral load (VL) in the newly infected partners. These results suggested that accumulation of CTL escape mutations in Gag might attenuate viral replication and provide a clinical benefit during early stages of infection. Using a novel approach, we have cloned gag sequences isolated from the earliest seroconversion plasma sample from the acutely infected recipient of 149 epidemiologically linked Zambian transmission pairs into a primary isolate, subtype C proviral vector, MJ4. We determined the replicative capacity (RC) of these Gag-MJ4 chimeras by infecting the GXR25 cell line and quantifying virion production in supernatants via a radiolabeled reverse transcriptase assay. We observed a statistically significant positive correlation between RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence and set point VL in newly infected individuals (p = 0.02). Furthermore, the RC of Gag-MJ4 chimeras also correlated with the VL of chronically infected donors near the estimated date of infection (p = 0.01), demonstrating that virus replication contributes to VL in both acute and chronic infection. These studies also allowed for the elucidation of novel sites in Gag associated with changes in RC, where rare mutations had the greatest effect on fitness. Although we observed both advantageous and deleterious rare mutations, the latter could point to vulnerable targets in the HIV-1 genome. Importantly, RC correlated significantly (p = 0.029) with the rate of CD4+ T cell decline over the first 3 years of infection in a manner that is partially independent of VL, suggesting that the replication capacity of HIV-1 during the earliest stages of infection is a determinant of pathogenesis beyond what might be expected based on set point VL alone.\n",
      "Few data exist on tuberculosis (TB) incidence according to time from HIV seroconversion in high-income countries and whether rates following initiation of a combination of antiretroviral treatments (cARTs) differ from those soon after seroconversion.\n",
      "Data on individuals with well estimated dates of HIV seroconversion were used to analyse post-seroconversion TB rates, ending at the earliest of 1 January 1997, death or last clinic visit. TB rates were also estimated following cART initiation, ending at the earliest of death or last clinic visit. Poisson models were used to examine the effect of current and past level of immunosuppression on TB risk after cART initiation.\n",
      "Of 19 815 individuals at risk during 1982-1996, TB incidence increased from 5.89/1000 person-years (PY) (95% CI 3.77 to 8.76) in the first year after seroconversion to 10.56 (4.83 to 20.04, p=0.01) at 10 years. Among 11 178 TB-free individuals initiating cART, the TB rate in the first year after cART initiation was 4.23/1000 PY (3.07 to 5.71) and dropped thereafter, remaining constant from year 2 onwards averaging at 1.64/1000 PY (1.29 to 2.05). Current CD4 count was inversely associated with TB rates, while nadir CD4 count was not associated with TB rates after adjustment for current CD4 count, HIV-RNA at cART initiation.\n",
      "TB risk increases with duration of HIV infection in the absence of cART. Following cART initiation, TB incidence rates were lower than levels immediately following seroconversion. Implementation of current recommendations to prevent TB in early HIV infection could be beneficial.\n",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, most people with HIV do not know they are infected.\n",
      "We conducted door-to-door home-based testing and counseling (HBTC) in rural western Kenya (Lwak) and an informal urban settlement in Nairobi (Kibera) in 2008. After consent, eligible persons (adults and adolescents aged 13 years or older and children aged 12 years or younger, whose biologic mother was HIV-infected or deceased) received parallel fingerstick HIV rapid testing and counseling. Persons newly diagnosed with HIV were referred to care services, fingerstick blood for CD4 testing was collected, and a one-month follow-up home visit was conducted.\n",
      "Among 24,450 people who were offered HBTC, 19,966 (81.7%) accepted; 65.4% of whom were HIV-tested for the first time. Prevalence in adults aged 18 years or older being HIV-tested for the first time was 13.5% (12.6%, Kibera; 14.2%, Lwak). Among adults who reported a previously negative test, HIV prevalence was 7.4% (7.2%, Kibera; 7.6%, Lwak). Among all persons with HIV in these communities, two-thirds were newly diagnosed through HBTC. Median CD4 count among newly diagnosed adults was 403 [interquartile range (IQR) = 252-594]. Among couples, 38.0% in Kibera and 51.7% in Lwak were counseled together. Among HIV-infected people in a couple, 34.6% had an HIV-uninfected partner. Among newly diagnosed HIV-infected persons, at the one-month follow-up visit, 53.6% in Kibera and 43.6% in Lwak reported having visited an HIV patient support center.\n",
      "HBTC acceptance was high and most HIV-infected persons did not previously know they had HIV. HBTC can be an effective strategy for early HIV diagnosis and treatment referral.\n",
      "The high diversity of HIV-1 has been shown to affect disease progression, transmission, and response to antiretroviral therapy and may influence HIV vaccine design. We describe the distribution trends of HIV-1 subtypes over a 7-year period among incident cases in a rural clinical cohort in Southwest Uganda and identify transmission clusters. Viral RNA was extracted from cryopreserved plasma samples from 94 participants who seroconverted and enrolled between 2004 and 2010. Partial gag (p24) and env (gp41) genes were directly sequenced to identify subtypes and transmission clusters with more than 95% bootstrap values. Direct sequencing of the partial pol gene and use of individual participant sexual life histories were also used to confirm these transmission clusters. The overall gag/env subtype distribution was A 28% (n=26), C 1% (n=1), and D 45% (n=42) and 27% (n=25) were intergene unique recombinant forms. The proportions of subtype A, D, or recombinants showed no significant increasing or decreasing trend over this time period (p=0.51). Phylogenetic analysis of the three genes confirmed 13 transmission clusters of which seven clusters were confirmed sexual partners using individual participants' sexual life histories. Subtype D has remained the predominant subtype in this population. From 2004 to 2010, there was no change in the proportions of these subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis and participants' sexual life histories revealed several transmission clusters. The high proportion of transmission clusters observed suggests continued high-risk sexual behavior and mixing in some individuals and possibly super transmitters in this presumed low-risk cohort, but also indicates that many transmissions occur in early HIV infection. This calls for early and targeted effective prevention and treatment intervention in this population.\n",
      "Breast milk is a major route of infant HIV infection, yet the majority of breast-fed, HIV-exposed infants escape infection by unknown mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the role of HIV-specific breast milk cells in preventing infant HIV infection.\n",
      "A prospective study was designed to measure associations between maternal breast milk HIV-specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses and infant HIV-1 detection at 1 month of age.\n",
      "In a Kenyan cohort of HIV-infected mothers, blood and breast milk HIV-gag IFN-γ ELISpot responses were measured. Logistic regression was used to measure associations between breast milk IFN-γ responses and infant HIV infection at 1 month of age.\n",
      "IFN-γ responses were detected in breast milk from 117 of 170 (69%) women. IFN-γ responses were associated with breast milk viral load, levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1α, MIP-1β, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted and stromal-cell derived factor 1 and subclinical mastitis. Univariate factors associated with infant HIV infection at 1 month postpartum included both detection and breadth of breast milk IFN-γ response (P = 0.08, P = 0.04, respectively), breast milk MIP-1β detection (P = 0.05), and plasma (P = 0.004) and breast milk (P = 0.004) viral load. In multivariate analyses adjusting for breast milk viral load and MIP-1β, breast milk IFN-γ responses were associated with an approximately 70% reduction in infant HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.092-0.91], and each additional peptide pool targeted was associated with an approximately 35% reduction in infant HIV (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.97).\n",
      "These data show breast milk HIV-gag-specific IFN-γ cellular immune responses are prevalent and may contribute to protection from early HIV transmission. More broadly, these data suggest breast milk cellular responses are potentially influential in decreasing mother-to-child transmission of viruses.\n",
      "In October 2005, individual donation nucleic acid amplification testing (ID-NAT) for HIV, HBV and HCV was introduced in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. After 5 years, the impact on HIV, HBV and HCV transmission risk was assessed.\n",
      "A total of 649745 donations were tested by ID-NAT using the Ultrio assay on the Tigris instrument (Novartis Diagnostics) and for anti-HIV, HBsAg and anti-HCV (Abbott Prism). Initial reactive samples were repeated in duplicate. Discrepant repeat reactive samples were subjected to confirmatory assays. ID-NAT nonrepeat reactive donations were further screened for occult HBV infection (OBI) by anti-HBc assay.\n",
      "ID-NAT yielded 6 HIV-RNA-positive donations in the anti-HIV-negative window period (WP) but only 2 were p24 Ag nonreactive (1:325000). Mathematical modelling estimated a similar HIV transmission risk for lapsed and repeat donations, in the order of 3 per million. The WP risk for HBV was 13 per million. Eight acute (1:81000) and 13 chronic OBI yield cases (1:50000) were interdicted. There were significantly more anti-HBc-positive donors in the Ultrio initial reactive/nonrepeat reactive group (12%) than in an Ultrio nonreactive control group (6%).\n",
      "ID-NAT in the Western Cape Province of South Africa has contributed significantly to enhancing blood safety, particularly for HBV transmission risk and to a lesser extent for HIV. Anti-HBc testing of NAT nonrepeat reactive donations seems useful in identifying a subgroup of donors with OBI who may be at risk of transmitting HBV.\n",
      "Task-shifting is promoted widely as a mechanism for expanding antiretroviral treatment (ART) access. However, the evidence for nurse-initiated and managed ART (NIMART) in Africa is limited, and little is known about the key barriers and enablers to implementing NIMART programmes on a large scale. The STRETCH (Streamlining Tasks and Roles to Expand Treatment and Care for HIV) programme was a complex educational and organisational intervention implemented in the Free State Province of South Africa to enable nurses providing primary HIV/AIDS care to expand their roles and include aspects of care and treatment usually provided by physicians. STRETCH used a phased implementation approach and ART treatment guidelines tailored specifically to nurses. The effects of STRETCH on pre-ART mortality, ART provision, and the quality of HIV/ART care were evaluated through a randomised controlled trial. This study was conducted alongside the trial to develop a contextualised understanding of factors affecting the implementation of the programme.\n",
      "This study was a qualitative process evaluation using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with patients, health workers, health managers, and other key informants as well as observation in clinics. Research questions focused on perceptions of STRETCH, changes in health provider roles, attitudes and patient relationships, and impact of the implementation context on trial outcomes. Data were analysed collaboratively by the research team using thematic analysis.\n",
      "NIMART appears to be highly acceptable among nurses, patients, and physicians. Managers and nurses expressed confidence in their ability to deliver ART successfully. This confidence developed slowly and unevenly, through a phased and well-supported approach that guided nurses through training, re-prescription, and initiation. The research also shows that NIMART changes the working and referral relationships between health staff, demands significant training and support, and faces workload and capacity constraints, and logistical and infrastructural challenges.\n",
      "Large-scale NIMART appears to be feasible and acceptable in the primary level public sector health services in South Africa. Successful implementation requires a comprehensive approach with: an incremental and well supported approach to implementation; clinical guidelines tailored to nurses; and significant health services reorganisation to accommodate the knock-on effects of shifts in practice.\n",
      "Preexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral agents has been shown to reduce the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among men who have sex with men; however, the efficacy among heterosexuals is uncertain.\n",
      "We randomly assigned HIV-seronegative men and women to receive either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) or matching placebo once daily. Monthly study visits were scheduled, and participants received a comprehensive package of prevention services, including HIV testing, counseling on adherence to medication, management of sexually transmitted infections, monitoring for adverse events, and individualized counseling on risk reduction; bone mineral density testing was performed semiannually in a subgroup of participants.\n",
      "A total of 1219 men and women underwent randomization (45.7% women) and were followed for 1563 person-years (median, 1.1 years; maximum, 3.7 years). Because of low retention and logistic limitations, we concluded the study early and followed enrolled participants through an orderly study closure rather than expanding enrollment. The TDF-FTC group had higher rates of nausea (18.5% vs. 7.1%, P<0.001), vomiting (11.3% vs. 7.1%, P=0.008), and dizziness (15.1% vs. 11.0%, P=0.03) than the placebo group, but the rates of serious adverse events were similar (P=0.90). Participants who received TDF-FTC, as compared with those who received placebo, had a significant decline in bone mineral density. K65R, M184V, and A62V resistance mutations developed in 1 participant in the TDF-FTC group who had had an unrecognized acute HIV infection at enrollment. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis that included the 33 participants who became infected during the study (9 in the TDF-FTC group and 24 in the placebo group; 1.2 and 3.1 infections per 100 person-years, respectively), the efficacy of TDF-FTC was 62.2% (95% confidence interval, 21.5 to 83.4; P=0.03).\n",
      "Daily TDF-FTC prophylaxis prevented HIV infection in sexually active heterosexual adults. The long-term safety of daily TDF-FTC prophylaxis, including the effect on bone mineral density, remains unknown.

      "Acute HIV infection (prior to antibody seroconversion) represents a high-risk window for HIV transmission. Development of a test to detect acute infection at the point-of-care is urgent.\n",
      "Volunteers enrolled in a prospective study of HIV incidence in four African cities, Kigali in Rwanda and Ndola, Kitwe and Lusaka in Zambia, were tested regularly for HIV by rapid antibody test and p24 antigen ELISA. Five subgroups of samples were also tested by the Determine Ag/Ab Combo test 1) Antigen positive, antibody negative (acute infection); 2) Antigen positive, antibody positive; 3) Antigen negative, antibody positive; 4) Antigen negative, antibody negative; and 5) Antigen false positive, antibody negative (HIV uninfected). A sixth group included serial dilutions from a p24 antigen-positive control sample. Combo test results were reported as antigen positive, antibody positive, or both.\n",
      "Of 34 group 1 samples with VL between 5x105 and >1.5x107 copies/mL (median 3.5x106), 1 (2.9%) was detected by the Combo antigen component, 7 (20.6%) others were positive by the Combo antibody component. No group 2 samples were antigen positive by the Combo test (0/18). Sensitivity of the Combo antigen test was therefore 1.9% (1/52, 95% CI 0.0, 9.9). One false positive Combo antibody result (1/30, 3.3%) was observed in group 4. No false-positive Combo antigen results were observed. The Combo antigen test was positive in group 6 at concentrations of 80 pg/mL, faintly positive at 40 and 20 pg/mL, and negative thereafter. The p24 ELISA antigen test remained positive at 5 pg/mL.\n",
      "Although the antibody component of the Combo test detected antibodies to HIV earlier than the comparison antibody tests used, less than 2% of the cases of antigen-positive HIV infection were detected by the Combo antigen component. The development of a rapid point-of-care test to diagnose acute HIV infection remains an urgent goal.\n",
      "To assess whether mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is useful in detecting non-adherence to AZTcontaining therapy.\n",
      "Observational study within randomised controlled trial.\n",
      "We combined data from two treatment arms in SPARTAC, an RCT of short-course cART in primary HIV infection, classifying participants as responders (HIV-RNA decrease ≥1 log(10) or reaching <400copies/ml) or nonresponders following cART initiation. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of using different percentage increases in MCV for accurately differentiating between responders and non-responders. We further examined changes in MCV levels up to 24 weeks after protocol-indicated cART cessation.\n",
      "Of 119 participants included in this analysis, 73 (61%) were women, 71 of whom were randomised in Africa. Ninety-eight (88%) and 84 (85%) were classified as responders at 4 and 12 weeks respectively following cART initiation. MCV increased by a mean 3% and 1% at week 4, and 14% and <1% at 12 weeks for responders and non-responders. A 2% MCV increase at 4 weeks had 62% sensitivity and specificity for identifying virological response. At 12 weeks, an 8% increase had 89% sensitivity and specificity. In responders, MCV remained lower for individuals in African compared to non-African sites throughout and rose from 85 vs 90 fL at cART start to 96 vs 103 fL at 12 weeks post-initiation then fell to 88 vs 93 fL and 86 vs 89 fL at 12 and 48 weeks post-cessation.\n",
      "In low-income countries, where HIV RNA may be unavailable, 12-weekly MCV measurements may be useful in monitoring adherence to AZT-containing regimens.\n",
      "HIV-1-infected individuals with higher viral set points progress to AIDS more rapidly than those with lower set points. Predicting viral set point early following infection can contribute to our understanding of early control of HIV-1 replication, to predicting long-term clinical outcomes, and to the choice of optimal therapeutic regimens.\n",
      "In a longitudinal study of 10 untreated HIV-1-infected patients, we used gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to identify transcriptional networks for viral set point prediction. At each sampling time, a statistical analysis inferred the optimal transcriptional network that best predicted viral set point. We then assessed the accuracy of this transcriptional model by predicting viral set point in an independent cohort of 10 untreated HIV-1-infected patients from Malawi.\n",
      "The gene network inferred at time of enrollment predicted viral set point 24 weeks later in the independent Malawian cohort with an accuracy of 87.5%. As expected, the predictive accuracy of the networks inferred at later time points was even greater, exceeding 90% after week 4. The composition of the inferred networks was largely conserved between time points. The 12 genes comprising this dynamic signature of viral set point implicated the involvement of two major canonical pathways: interferon signaling (p<0.0003) and membrane fraction (p<0.02). A silico knockout study showed that HLA-DRB1 and C4BPA may contribute to restricting HIV-1 replication.\n",
      "Longitudinal gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute HIV-1 infection can be used to create transcriptional network models to early predict viral set point with a high degree of accuracy.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) superinfection has been documented in high-risk individuals; however, the rate of superinfection among HIV-infected individuals within a general population remains unknown.\n",
      "A novel next-generation ultra-deep sequencing technique was utilized to determine the rate of HIV superinfection in a heterosexual population by examining two regions of the viral genome in longitudinal samples from recent HIV seroconverters (n=149) in Rakai District, Uganda.\n",
      "The rate of superinfection was 1.44 per 100 person years (PYs) (95% confidence interval [CI], .4-2.5) and consisted of both inter- and intrasubtype superinfections. This was compared to primary HIV incidence in 20 220 initially HIV-negative individuals in the general population in Rakai (1.15 per 100 PYs; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2; P= .26). Propensity score matching (PS) was used to control for differences in sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics between the HIV-positive individuals at risk for superinfection and the HIV-negative population at baseline and follow-up. After PS matching, the estimated rate of primary incidence was 3.28 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 2.0-5.3; P = .07) controlling for baseline differences and 2.51 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 1.5-4.3; P = .24) controlling for follow-up differences.\n",
      "This suggests that the rate of HIV superinfection in a general population is substantial, which could have a significant impact on future public health and HIV vaccine strategies.\n",
      "To determine the impact of HIV on child mortality and explore potential risk factors for mortality among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children in a longitudinal cohort in rural Uganda.\n",
      "From July 2002 to March 2010, HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children aged 6 weeks-13 years were enrolled in an open population-based clinical cohort. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was introduced in 2005. Clinical and laboratory data were collected every 3 months. Person-years at risk were calculated from time of enrolment until earliest date of ART initiation, death or last visit. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for mortality.\n",
      "Eighty-nine (30.2%) HIV-infected and 206 (69.8%) HIV-exposed but uninfected children were enrolled. Twenty-one children died. The mortality rate was six times higher in ART-naive HIV-infected children than in HIV-exposed but uninfected children (HR = 6.4, 95% CI = 2.4-16.6). Among HIV-infected children, mortality was highest in those aged <2 years. Decreasing weight-for-age Z (WAZ) score was the strongest risk factor for mortality among HIV-infected children (HR for unit decrease in WAZ = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.6-4.1). Thirty-five children (aged 7 months-15.6 years; median, 5.4 years) started ART.\n",
      "Mortality among HIV-infected children was highest among those aged <2 years. Intensified efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV and ensure early HIV diagnosis and treatment are required to decrease child mortality caused by HIV in rural Africa.\n",
      "To assess the level of intra-patient diversity and evolution of HIV-1C non-structural genes in primary infection, viral quasispecies obtained by single genome amplification (SGA) at multiple sampling timepoints up to 500 days post-seroconversion (p/s) were analyzed. The mean intra-patient diversity was 0.11% (95% CI; 0.02 to 0.20) for vif, 0.23% (95% CI; 0.08 to 0.38) for vpr, 0.35% (95% CI; -0.05 to 0.75) for vpu, 0.18% (95% CI; 0.01 to 0.35) for tat exon 1 and 0.30% (95% CI; 0.02 to 0.58) for rev exon 1 during the time period 0 to 90 days p/s. The intra-patient diversity increased gradually in all non-structural genes over the first year of HIV-1 infection, which was evident from the vif mean intra-patient diversity of 0.46% (95% CI; 0.28 to 0.64), vpr 0.44% (95% CI; 0.24 to 0.64), vpu 0.84% (95% CI; 0.55 to 1.13), tat exon 1 0.35% (95% CI; 0.14 to 0.56 ) and rev exon 1 0.42% (95% CI; 0.18 to 0.66) during the time period of 181 to 500 days p/s. There was a statistically significant increase in viral diversity for vif (p = 0.013) and vpu (p = 0.002). No associations between levels of viral diversity within the non-structural genes and HIV-1 RNA load during primary infection were found. The study details the dynamics of the non-structural viral genes during the early stages of HIV-1C infection.\n",
      "Late presentation is common among African HIV-1-infected infants. Incidence and correlates of mortality were examined in 99 infants with HIV-1 diagnosis by 5 months of age. Twelve-month survival was 66.8% (95% confidence interval: 55.9-75.6%). World Health Organization stage 3 or 4, underweight, wasting, microcephaly, low hemoglobin, pneumonia and gastroenteritis predicted mortality. Early HIV-1 diagnosis with antiretroviral therapy before symptomatic disease is critical for infant survival.\n",
      "Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduces HIV-related infant mortality. The early peak of pediatric HIV-related deaths in South Africa occurs at 3 months of age, coinciding with the earliest age at which treatment is initiated following PCR testing at 6 weeks of age. Earlier diagnosis is necessary to reduce infant mortality. The performances of the Amplicor DNA PCR, COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM), and Aptima assays for detecting early HIV infection (acquired in utero and intrapartum) up to 6 weeks of age were compared. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected at birth and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks from HIV-exposed infants enrolled in an observational cohort study in Johannesburg, South Africa. HIV status was determined at 6 weeks by DNA PCR on whole blood. Serial DBS samples from all HIV-infected infants and two HIV-uninfected, age-matched controls were tested with the 3 assays. Of 710 infants of known HIV status, 38 (5.4%) had in utero (n = 29) or intrapartum (n = 9) infections. By 14 weeks, when treatment should have been initiated, 13 (45%) in utero-infected and 2 (22%) intrapartum-infected infants had died or were lost to follow-up. The CAP/CTM and Aptima assays identified 76.3% of all infants with early HIV infections at birth and by 4 weeks were 96% sensitive. DNA PCR demonstrated lower sensitivities at birth and 4 weeks of 68.4% and 87.5%, respectively. All assays had the lowest sensitivity at 2 weeks of age. CAP/CTM was the only assay with 100% specificity at all ages. Testing at birth versus 6 weeks of age identifies a higher total number of HIV-infected infants, irrespective of the assay.\n",
      "Currently used 3rd generation rapid HIV-tests in resource-limited settings do not detect acute HIV-infections (AHI). They are known to detect HIV-infections after or late in the \"window period\". Detecting incident-HIV infections early in pregnancy increases opportunities for initiating antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n",
      "We evaluated the Determine(®) HIV1/2 Ag/Ab Combo Rapid Test (Combo RT), a 4th generation test against two 3rd generation tests (SENSA-HIV1/2/0 Tri-line, SD-Bioline) for early detection of HIV-infection in pregnancy.\n",
      "In a cohort study, plasma samples from 32 pregnant women who seroconverted at a subsequent antenatal visit (incident-infection), samples from 189 women who tested HIV positive at baseline (established-infections) and samples from 32 women remaining HIV-seronegative at a subsequent antenatal visit were tested with 3rd generation (antibody detection only) and 4th generation (antibody/antigen detection) rapid HIV tests. The HIV-1 NucliSENSEasyQ(®) v2.0 PCR test was used to quantify HIV-viral copies in women with incident HIV-infections.\n",
      "Eighteen of 32 (56.3%) women (incident-infections) had detectable viral copies (baseline); 16 (88.9%) were antibody reactive with the Combo RT. None of the 32 specimens were reactive on the antigen component of the Combo RT. The sensitivity and specificity of the Combo RT in detecting HIV infections prior to seroconversion is 59.4% (95%CI 40.6-76.3) and 96.9% (95%CI 83.8-99.9) respectively. The Combo RT detected 94.0% of all HIV-infections if used as a screening test (baseline) compared to 85.5% detected by 3rd generation tests.\n",

      "Acute phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) may account for a significant proportion of HIV-1 transmission. We identified and characterized individuals in Nigeria with AHI.\n",
      "Individuals were tested using a combination of rapid HIV testing in mobile units and laboratory-based specimen pooling for nucleic acid amplification testing. Genome sequences were characterized. A linear segmented regression model was fit to serial viral load (VL) measurements to characterize early VL profiles.\n",
      "Sixteen AHIs were identified from 28 655 persons screened. Specimens were genotyped: 7 (43.8%) were CRF02_AG, 6 (37.5%) were subtype G, 1 (6.3%) was CRF06_cpx, and 2 (12.5%) were unique recombinant forms. No antiretroviral resistance mutations were detected. The mean duration of high VL burden from peak to nadir was 76 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 58-93 days), and the mean rate of viremic control was -0.66 log(10) VL per month. The mean VL at set-point was 4.5 log(10) copies/mL (95% CI, 3.9-5.1 log(10) copies/mL).\n",
      "This study is the first to characterize AHI among Nigerians identified as HIV infected before seroconversion who would be otherwise missed by conventional HIV testing. Infections by HIV subtypes in Nigeria exhibit long periods of high viral burden, which can contribute to increased transmissibility.\n",
      "HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy in 4 studies: 1) the CAPRISA 004 trial of pericoital administration of 1% tenofovir gel showed moderate (39%) efficacy in reducing risk of HIV acquisition in young women; 2) the iPrEx trial of daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir had moderate (44%) efficacy in reducing risk of HIV acquisition among high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM); 3) the Partners PrEP Study in African HIV-serodiscordant couples, in which the HIV-seronegative partner received daily oral tenofovir or emtricitabine/tenofovir, showed high efficacy (62% and 73%, respectively); and 4) the TDF2 trial in young heterosexual men and women in Botswana demonstrated 62% efficacy of daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir. Greater adherence to PrEP is associated with greater efficacy. Resistance to tenofovir and emtricitabine have been rare and were primarily observed during PrEP initiation in those with acute HIV infection. PrEP has been found to be safe and well tolerated. The FEM-PrEP trial of oral emtricitabine/tenofovir and the VOICE trials of daily 1% tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir (both studies conducted in African women) did not show protective benefit, for reasons that currently remain unknown. The Bangkok Tenofovir Study of oral tenofovir in injection drug users, and the emtricitabine/tenofovir study arm of the VOICE trial, are ongoing. Establishing PrEP programs will be a great challenge and a great opportunity. This article summarizes a presentation by Connie L. Celum, MD, MPH, at the IAS-USA live continuing education course held in Chicago in June 2011, and includes updates on PrEP trial results reported since July 2011.\n",
      "HIV infection is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function, mainly in the CD4 compartment. To better understand the dynamics of HIV-specific T cells, we analyzed the kinetics and polyfunctional profiles of Gag-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses in 12 subtype C-infected individuals with different disease-progression profiles, ranging from acute to chronic HIV infection. The frequencies of Gag-responsive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells showed distinct temporal kinetics. The peak frequency of Gag-responsive IFN-γ(+)CD4(+) T cells was observed at a median of 28 d (interquartile range: 21-81 d) post-Fiebig I/II staging, whereas Gag-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell responses peaked at a median of 253 d (interquartile range: 136-401 d) and showed a significant biphasic expansion. The proportion of TNF-α-expressing cells within the IFN-γ(+)CD4(+) T cell population increased (p = 0.001) over time, whereas TNF-α-expressing cells within IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cells declined (p = 0.005). Both Gag-responsive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells showed decreased Ki67 expression within the first 120 d post-Fiebig I/II staging. Prior to the disappearance of Gag-responsive Ki67(+)CD4(+) T cells, these cells positively correlated (p = 0.00038) with viremia, indicating that early Gag-responsive CD4 events are shaped by viral burden. No such associations were observed in the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell compartment. Overall, these observations indicated that circulating Gag-responsive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell frequencies and functions are not synchronous, and properties change rapidly at different tempos during early HIV infection.\n",
      "Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) point-of-care tests detect antibodies (Ab) but not p24 antigen (Ag) or RNA. In the absence of antibodies, p24 antigen and RNA typically indicate acute HIV infection. We conducted a field evaluation of the Determine® HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo rapid test (Combo RT).\n",
      "The antigen portion of the Combo RT (for acute HIV infection) was compared with a Roche Monitor HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction assay. The antibody portion of Combo RT (for established HIV infection) was compared with rapid test algorithms. Participants were enrolled at a sexually transmitted infection clinic and HIV testing and counseling center in Lilongwe, Malawi. Rapid testing was conducted with parallel testing in the clinic and serial testing in the center. The Combo RT was performed in clinic participants with negative or discordant antibody results and in all center participants.\n",
      "Of the participants 838 were HIV negative, 163 had established HIV infection, and 8 had acute HIV infection. For detecting acute HIV infection, the antigen portion had a sensitivity of 0.000 and a specificity of 0.983. For detecting established HIV infection, the antibody portion had a sensitivity of 0.994 and a specificity of 0.992.\n",
      "Combo RT displayed excellent performance for detecting established HIV infection and poor performance for detecting acute HIV infection. In this setting, Combo RT is no more useful than current algorithms.\n",
      "The biggest challenge in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) prevention in Africa is the high HIV-1 burden in young women. In macaques, proinflammatory cytokine production in the genital tract is necessary for target cell recruitment and establishment of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection following vaginal inoculation. The purpose of this study was to assess if genital inflammation during early HIV-1 infection predisposes women to rapid disease progression.\n",
      "Inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from 49 women 6, 17, 30, and 55 weeks after HIV-1 infection and from 22 of these women before infection. Associations between genital inflammation and viral load set point and blood CD4 cell counts 12 months after infection were investigated.\n",
      "Elevated genital cytokine concentrations 6 and 17 weeks after HIV-1 infection were associated with higher viral load set points and, to a lesser extent, with CD4 depletion. CVL cytokine concentrations during early infection did not differ relative to preinfection but were elevated in women who had vaginal discharge, detectable HIV-1 RNA in their genital tracts, and lower blood CD4 counts.\n",
      "Genital inflammation during early HIV-1 infection was associated with higher viral load set point and CD4 depletion, which are markers of rapid disease progression. Strategies aimed at reducing genital inflammation during early HIV-1 infection may slow disease progression.\n",
      "HIV rapid tests (RT) play an important role in tackling the HIV pandemic in South Africa. Third generation RT that detect HIV antibodies are currently used to diagnose HIV infection at the point of care. Determine Combo (DC) is the first fourth generation RT that detects both p24 antigen (p24Ag) and HIV antibodies (Ab), theoretically reducing the window period and increasing detection rates. Early detection of maternal HIV infection is important to mitigate the high risk of vertical transmission associated with acute maternal infection.\n",

Ninety women (8.8%) tested HIV-positive of whom 59 (66%) were tested antenatally, and 31 (34%) post-partum yielding prevalence rates of 17.1% and 4.6% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the Ab component of DC on plasma antenatally was 100% (93.8% - 100%) and 100% (98.6% - 100%) respectively and post-partum was 100% (88.9% - 100%) and 99.6% (98.8% - 99.9%) respectively. One false positive and not a single true positive p24Ag was detected. Of 505 post-partum women who tested HIV-negative 6-12 months prior to enrolment, 12 (2.4%) seroconverted.\n",
      "The fourth generation DC offered no advantage over current third generation RT in the diagnosis of HIV infection.\n",
      "The male genital tract is of major importance in the transmission and acquisition of HIV-1. Studying cellular immunity in the male genital tract is important in development of HIV-1 vaccines protective at mucosal sites. Semen is the primary HIV-1 containing fluid released from the male genital tract and reducing virus levels in semen would also reduce HIV-1 spread. Characterizing lymphocytes from semen requires the isolation of viable T cells that can be analyzed by downstream applications such as flow cytometry. The aims of this study were to investigate the influence of various parameters on CD3(+) T cell yields from semen and to compare isolation methods to maximize CD3(+) T cell yields for the purpose of functional characterization by flow cytometry.\n",
      "The influence of abstinence, storage temperature and time till processing on semen CD3(+) T cell yields was investigated. Seminal CD3(+) T cell yields were evaluated by comparing gradient separation, enzymatic digestion, filtration and magnetic bead capture. The function and viability of seminal CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were assayed by flow cytometry.\n",
      "We found that the use of pronase and cell strainers resulted in significantly higher CD3(+) T cell yields when compared to gradient separation alone. Positive selection of CD3(+) cells using magnetic bead purification resulted in significantly higher yields and improved resolution of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry. Processing of samples should occur as expediently as possible to maximize CD3(+) T cell yields. However, if this is not possible, loss of CD3(+) T cells can be minimized by storing samples at 37°C for up to one day post ejaculation.\n",
      "We describe a simple method for the isolation of functional T cells from semen. Developing standardized methods for processing samples and measuring immunity in the male genital tract may be important in clinical trials of not only candidate HIV-1 vaccines, but in better understanding cellular immunity to a range of sexually transmitted infections of global significance.\n",
      "To describe symptoms, physical examination findings, and set-point viral load associated with acute HIV seroconversion in a heterosexual cohort of HIV-discordant couples in Zambia.\n",
      "We followed HIV serodiscordant couples in Lusaka, Zambia from 1995 to 2009 with HIV testing of negative partners and symptom inventories 3 monthly, and physical examinations annually.\n",
      "We compared prevalence of self-reported or treated symptoms (malaria syndrome, chronic diarrhea, asthenia, night sweats, and oral candidiasis) and annual physical examination findings (unilateral or bilateral neck, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy; and dermatosis) in seroconverting vs. HIV-negative or HIV-positive intervals, controlling for repeated observations, age, and sex. A composite score comprised of significant symptoms and physical examination findings predictive of seroconversion vs. HIV-negative intervals was constructed. We modeled the relationship between number of symptoms and physical examination findings at seroconversion and log set-point viral load using linear regression.\n",
      "Two thousand, three hundred and eighty-eight HIV-negative partners were followed for a median of 18 months; 429 seroconversions occurred. Neither symptoms nor physical examination findings were reported for most seroconverters. Seroconversion was significantly associated with malaria syndrome among nondiarrheic patients [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.0], night sweats (aOR = 1.4), and bilateral axillary (aOR = 1.6), inguinal (aOR = 2.2), and neck (aOR = 2.2) adenopathy relative to HIV-negative intervals. Median number of symptoms and findings was positively associated with set-point viral load (P < 0.001).\n",
      "Although most acute and early infections were asymptomatic, malaria syndrome was more common and more severe during seroconversion. When present, symptoms and physical examination findings were nonspecific and associated with higher set-point viremia.\n",
      "Few studies have explored the role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in controlling HIV-2 viremia and disease progression. Using a TZM-bl neutralization assay, we assessed heterologous and autologous NAb responses from a community cohort of HIV-2-infected individuals with a broad range of disease outcomes in rural Guinea-Bissau. All subjects (n = 40) displayed exceptionally high heterologous NAb titers (50% inhibitory plasma dilution or 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 1:7,000 to 1:1,000,000) against 5 novel primary HIV-2 envelopes and HIV-2 7312A, whereas ROD A and 3 primary envelopes were relatively resistant to neutralization. Most individuals also showed high autologous NAb against contemporaneous envelopes (78% of plasma-envelope combinations in 69 envelopes from 21 subjects), with IC(50)s above 1:10,000. No association between heterologous or autologous NAb titer and greater control of HIV-2 was found. A subset of envelopes was found to be more resistant to neutralization (by plasma and HIV-2 monoclonal antibodies). These envelopes were isolated from individuals with greater intrapatient sequence diversity and were associated with changes in potential N-linked glycosylation sites but not CD4 independence or CXCR4 use. Plasma collected from up to 15 years previously was able to potently neutralize recent autologous envelopes, suggesting a lack of escape from NAb and the persistence of neutralization-sensitive variants over time, despite significant NAb pressure. We conclude that despite the presence of broad and potent NAb responses in HIV-2-infected individuals, these are not the primary forces behind the dichotomous outcomes observed but reveal a limited capacity for adaptive selection and escape from host immunity in HIV-2 infection.\n",
      "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality among HIV-infected individuals in the developing world. While CMV infection is nearly ubiquitous in resource-poor settings, few data are available on the role of subclinical CMV reactivation on HIV.\n",
      "Using a cohort of mineworkers with stored plasma samples, we investigated the association between CMV DNA concentration and mortality prior to antiretroviral therapy availability.\n",
      "Among 1341 individuals (median CD4 count 345 cells/µl, 70% WHO stage 1 or 2, median follow-up 0.9 years), 70 (5.2%) had CMV viremia at baseline; 71 deaths occurred. In univariable analysis CMV viremia at baseline was associated with a three-fold increase in mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.37; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.60, 7.10). After adjustment for CD4 count, WHO stage and HIV viral load (N = 429 with complete data), the association was attenuated (HR 2.27; 95%CI 0.88, 5.83). Mortality increased with higher CMV viremia (≥1,000 copies/ml vs. no viremia, adjusted HR 3.65, 95%CI: 1.29, 10.41). Results were similar using time-updated CMV viremia.\n",
      "High copy number, subclinical CMV viremia was an independent risk factor for mortality among male HIV-infected adults in South Africa with relatively early HIV disease. Studies to determine whether anti-CMV therapy to mitigate high copy number viremia would increase lifespan are warranted.\n",
      "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals to prevent acquisition of the virus during high-risk sexual encounters, enjoyed its first 2 major successes with the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 004 and the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx). These successes were buoyed by additional positive results from the TDF2 and Partners PrEP trials. Although no seroconverters in either arm of CAPRISA developed resistance to tenofovir, 2 participants in iPrEx with undetected, seronegative acute HIV infection were randomized to receive daily oral tenofovir-emtricitabine and resistance to emtricitabine was later discovered in both men. A similar case in the TDF2 study resulted in resistance to both ARVs. These cases prompted us to examine existing literature on the nature of resistance mutations elicited by ARVs used for PrEP. Here, we discuss the impact of signature mutations selected by PrEP, how rapidly these emerge with daily ARV exposure, and the individual-level and public health consequences of ARV resistance.\n",
      "Provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) is a routine HIV counseling and testing offered to adult clients attending at health care facilities. In Tanzania PITC started in 2007, with the aim of increasing early HIV diagnosis and timely access to care, treatment and support services. The objective of this study was to assess the level of knowledge and practice of health care providers on PITC. This cross sectional study was conducted in April-May 2010 among nurses and clinicians working in the government health care facilities in Mbeya City, south-western Tanzania. Self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain relevant information from the study participants. A total of 402 (95% response rate) care providers were interviewed. Their mean (+/- SD) age was 41 +/- 9.5 years. The majority 304 (76%) were nurses. Their duration of practice ranged from 4 months to 39 years. All the care providers reported to be aware of PITC services. However, 35% of them had inadequate knowledge of PITC and 269 (67%) reported to have ever offered PITC services. Median number of clients attended per week was 3 (IQR, 1-6 clients). Participants who had attended special training on PITC were 6-fold more likely to offer PITC services [OR = 6.2, 95% CI = 3.7-10.2; P < 0.001] than those who had not attended. In conclusion more than one-third of health providers do not routinely offer PITC in Mbeya City, leading to missed opportunity for early HIV diagnosis. On job and in-service training to improve PITC knowledge and supportive supervision for those trained is required.\n",
      "In efficacy trials male circumcision (MC) protected men against HIV infection. Planners need information relevant to MC programmes in practice. In 2008, we interviewed 2915 men and 4549 women aged 15-29 years in representative cluster samples in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland, asking about socio-economic characteristics, knowledge and attitudes about HIV and MC and MC history. We tested finger prick blood samples for HIV. We calculated weighted frequencies of MC knowledge and attitudes, and MC history and HIV status. Multivariate analysis examined associations between MC and other variables and HIV status. In Botswana, 11% of young men reported MC, 28% in Namibia and 8% in Swaziland; mostly (75% in Botswana, 94% - mostly Herero - in Namibia and 68% in Swaziland) as infants or children. Overall, 6.5% were HIV positive (8.3% Botswana, 2.6% Namibia and 9.1% Swaziland). Taking other variables into account, circumcised men were as likely as uncircumcised men to be HIV positive. Nearly half of the uncircumcised young men planned to be circumcised; two-thirds of young men and women planned to have their sons circumcised. Some respondents had inaccurate beliefs and unhelpful views about MC and HIV, with variation between countries. Between 9 and 15% believed a circumcised man is fully protected against HIV; 20-26% believed men need not be tested for HIV before MC; 14-26% believed HIV-positive men who are circumcised cannot transmit the virus; and 8-34% thought it was \"okay for a circumcised man to expect sex without a condom\". Inaccurate perceptions about protection from MC could lead to risk compensation and reduce women's ability to negotiate safer sex. More efforts are needed to raise awareness about the limitations of MC protection, especially for women, and to study the interactions between MC roll out programmes and primary HIV prevention programmes.\n",
      "Cardiovascular abnormalities were appreciated early in the epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), even before the aetiological agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was isolated and characterised. The aetiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HIV infection is still the subject of intense speculation, and is likely multi-factorial. HIV affects every aspect of the cardiac axis, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and microvascular dysfunction, valvular heart disease, pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. HIV-associated vasculopathy is an increasingly recognised clinical entity, causing high morbidity and increasing mortality in southern Africa, particularly from stroke and cardiovascular disease. HIV causes disease of the vascular tree, either by a direct effect on vascular or perivascular tissue, or indirectly via immune complex-mediated mechanisms, associated opportunistic infections and malignancies. As a result, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may have an important role in controlling disease progression. We report a case of histologically defined primary HIV vasculopathy in which the chance to start HAART was initially missed and in which the patient progressed to require bilateral amputations, but obtained disease quiescence upon commencement of HAART.\n",
      "We assessed attitudes and practices of health care workers (HCWs) toward HIV counselling and testing (CT) routinely offered to infants in health facilities in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.\n",
      "We performed a cross-sectional survey inquiring on systematic HIV CT offered to children aged 6-26 weeks attending postnatal care for either immunization or pediatric care and to their parents in 4 community health centres rolling-out access to antiretroviral therapy. Data were collected using standardized anonymous self-questionnaires directed to all HCWs involved.\n",
      "One-hundred five HCWs were interviewed in 2008: 30% were social workers, 27% physicians, 24% nurses and 19% laboratory technicians. Among immunization staff (n = 45), none trained in child CT versus 26% in pediatric services (n = 60, P < 0001). Almost all staff believed that it is important to offer HIV screening services to children and the best place could be during pediatric consultations. In their daily work, 22% of immunization staff and 48% of pediatric care staff had already been dealing with early HIV CT (P = 0.01). Facing a child suspected to be HIV infected, only 54% of providers in pediatrics and 71% in immunization would offer CT to all family members (P = 0.01).\n",
      "In Abidjan, although HCWs were generally in favour of pediatric HIV screening, very few had received specific training to do so. Deleguation of CT to the primary care level could improve coverage of CT services. It is urgent to train HCWs to promote early infant HIV diagnosis to improve earlier access to antiretroviral therapy in West African HIV-infected children.\n",
      "Although tenofovir (TDF) is a common component of antiretroviral therapy (ART), recent evidence suggests inferior outcomes when it is combined with nevirapine (NVP).\n",
      "We compared outcomes among patients initiating TDF + emtricitabine or lamivudine (XTC) + NVP, TDF + XTC + efavirenz (EFV), zidovudine (ZDV) + lamuvidine (3TC) + NVP, and ZDV + 3TC + EFV. We categorized drug exposure by initial ART dispensation by a time-varying analysis that accounted for drug substitutions and by predominant exposure (>75% of drug dispensations) during an initial window period. Risks for death and program failure were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. All regimens were compared with ZDV + 3TC + NVP.\n",
      "Between July 2007 and November 2010, 18,866 treatment-naive adults initiated ART: 18.2% on ZDV + 3TC + NVP, 1.8% on ZDV + 3TC + EFV, 36.2% on TDF + XTC + NVP, and 43.8% on TDF + XTC + EFV. When exposure was categorized by initial prescription, patients on TDF + XTC + NVP [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 to 2.06] had a higher post-90-day mortality. TDF + XTC + NVP was also associated with an elevated risk for mortality when exposure was categorized as time-varying (AHR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.95) or by predominant exposure over the first 90 days (AHR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.09 to 3.34). However, these findings were not consistently observed across sensitivity analyses or when program failure was used as a secondary outcome.\n",
      "TDF + XTC + NVP was associated with higher mortality when compared with ZDV + 3TC + NVP but not consistently across sensitivity analyses. These findings may be explained in part by inherent limitations to our retrospective approach, including residual confounding. Further research is urgently needed to compare the effectiveness of ART regimens in use in resource-constrained settings.\n",
      "The objectives of this study were to determine the capacity of BED incidence testing to a) estimate the effect of a HIV prevention intervention and b) provide adequate statistical power, when used among young people from sub-Saharan African settings with high HIV incidence rates.\n",
      "Firstly, after having elaborated plausible scenarios based on empirical data and the characteristics of the BED HIV-1 Capture EIA (BED) assay, we conducted statistical calculations to determine the BED theoretical power and HIV incidence rate ratio (IRR) associated with an intervention when using BED incidence testing. Secondly, we simulated a cross-sectional study conducted in a population among whom an HIV intervention was rolled out. Simulated data were analyzed using a log-linear Poisson model to recalculate the IRR and its confidence interval, and estimate the BED practical power. Calculations were conducted with and without corrections for misclassifications.\n",
      "Calculations showed that BED incidence testing can yield a BED theoretical power of 75% or more of the power that can be obtained in a classical cohort study conducted over a duration equal to the BED window period. Statistical analyses using simulated populations showed that the effect of a prevention intervention can be estimated with precision using classical statistical analysis of BED incidence testing data, even with an imprecise knowledge of the characteristics of the BED assay. The BED practical power was lower but of the same magnitude as the BED theoretical power.\n",
      "BED incidence testing can be applied to reasonably small samples to achieve good statistical power when used among young people to estimate IRR.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8(+) responses contribute to the decline in acute peak viremia following infection. However, data on the relative immunogenicity of CD8(+) T-cell epitopes during and after acute viremia are lacking.\n",
      "We characterized CD8(+) T-cell responses in 20 acutely infected, antiretroviral-naive individuals with HIV-1 subtype C infection using the interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Eleven of these had not fully seroconverted at the time of analysis. Viruses from plasma were sequenced within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cell epitopes for selected subjects.\n",
      "At approximately 28 days after estimated initial infection, CD8(+) T-cell responses were directed against an average of 3 of the 410 peptides tested (range, 0-6); 2 individuals had no detectable responses at this time. At 18 weeks, the average number of peptides targeted had increased to 5 (range 0-11). Of the 56 optimal Gag CTL epitopes sequenced, 31 were wild-type in the infecting viruses, but only 11 of 31 elicited measurable CD8(+) T-cell responses.\n",
      "These data demonstrate that the majority of CD8(+) responses are not elicited during acute HIV infection despite the presence of the cognate epitope in the infecting strain. There is a need to define factors that influence lack of induction of effective immune responses and the parameters that dictate immunodominance in acute infection.\n",
      "There are few data on the epidemiology of primary HIV-1 drug resistance after the roll-out of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to assess the prevalence of primary resistance in six African countries after ART roll-out and if wider use of ART in sub-Saharan Africa is associated with rising prevalence of drug resistance.\n",
      "We did a cross-sectional study in antiretroviral-naive adults infected with HIV-1 who had not started first-line ART, recruited between 2007 and 2009 from 11 regions in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. We did population-based sequencing of the pol gene on plasma specimens with greater than 1000 copies per mL of HIV RNA. We identified drug-resistance mutations with the WHO list for transmitted resistance. The prevalence of sequences containing at least one drug-resistance mutation was calculated accounting for the sampling weights of the sites. We assessed the risk factors of resistance with multilevel logistic regression with random coefficients.\n",
      "2436 (94.1%) of 2590 participants had a pretreatment genotypic resistance result. 1486 participants (57.4%) were women, 1575 (60.8%) had WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease, and the median CD4 count was 133 cells per μL (IQR 62-204). Overall sample-weighted drug-resistance prevalence was 5.6% (139 of 2436; 95% CI 4.6-6.7), ranging from 1.1% (two of 176; 0.0-2.7) in Pretoria, South Africa, to 12.3% (22 of 179; 7.5-17.1) in Kampala, Uganda. The pooled prevalence for all three Ugandan sites was 11.6% (66 of 570; 8.9-14.2), compared with 3.5% (73 of 1866; 2.5-4.5) for all other sites. Drug class-specific resistance prevalence was 2.5% (54 of 2436; 1.8-3.2) for nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 3.3% (83 of 2436; 2.5-4.2) for non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), 1.3% (31 of 2436; 0.8-1.8) for protease inhibitors, and 1.2% (25 of 2436; 0.7-1.7) for dual-class resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs. The most common drug-resistance mutations were K103N (43 [1.8%] of 2436), thymidine analogue mutations (33 [1.6%] of 2436), M184V (25 [1.2%] of 2436), and Y181C/I (19 [0.7%] of 2436). The odds ratio for drug resistance associated with each additional year since the start of the ART roll-out in a region was 1.38 (95% CI 1.13-1.68; p=0.001).\n",

      "We determined the prevalence of renal impairment and possible HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) in adults with World Health Organization (WHO) stages I or II HIV, presenting to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic in a central hospital in Malawi. We enrolled 526 ART-naïve subjects, 67% women, median age 34 (17-73) years and mean CD4 count 305 (3-993) cells/μL. Blood pressure, weight, urine dipstick and microscopy, CD4 cell count and serum creatinine were measured. Creatinine clearance (CrCL) was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Possible HIVAN was diagnosed based on levels of proteinuria and CrCl. In all, 23.3% had proteinuria (≥ 1+). 57.4% had reduced CrCl (< 90 mL/minute): 18.8% had moderate (CrCl 30-59 mL/minute) and 2.2% severe (CrCl <30 mL/minute) renal dysfunction. Extrapolating from renal biopsy studies that confirmed HIVAN, the proportion of patients with HIVAN in our clinic ranges from 1.8-21.2%. We conclude that renal impairment was common, though rarely severe, among HIV-infected adults with clinically non-advanced HIV disease. Renal dysfunction has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for (early) mortality. These results are relevant for ART programmes, such as those in Malawi, where renal function is not routinely assessed.\n",
      "The World Health Organization recommends screening donor blood for HIV in centralized laboratories. This recommendation contributes to quality, but presents specimen transport challenges for resource-limited settings which may be relieved by using dried blood spots (DBS). In sub-Saharan Africa, most countries screen donor blood with serologic assays only. Interest in window period reduction has led blood services to consider adding HIV nucleic acid testing (NAT). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that HIV-1 NAT blood screening assays have a 95% detection limit at or below 100 copies/ml and 5000 copies/ml for pooled and individual donations, respectively. The Roche COBAS Ampliscreen HIV-1 test, version 1.5, used for screening whole blood or components for transfusion, has not been tested with DBS. We compared COBAS Ampliscreen HIV-1 RNA detection limits in DBS and plasma. An AIDS Clinical Trials Group, Viral Quality Assurance laboratory HIV-1 standard with a known viral load was used to create paired plasma and DBS standard nine member dilution series. Each was tested in 24 replicates with the COBAS Ampliscreen. A probit analysis was conducted to calculate 95% detection limits for plasma and DBS, which were 23.8 copies/ml (95% CI 15.1-51.0) for plasma and 106.7 copies/ml (95% CI 73.8-207.9) for DBS. The COBAS Ampliscreen detection threshold with DBS suggests acceptability for individual donations, but optimization may be required for pooled specimens.\n",
      "Late diagnosis of HIV infection is a major challenge to the scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment. In 2005 Uganda adopted provider-initiated HIV testing in the health care setting to ensure earlier HIV diagnosis and linkage to care. We provided HIV testing to patients at Mulago hospital in Uganda, and performed CD4 tests to assess disease stage at diagnosis.\n",
      "Patients who had never tested for HIV or tested negative over one year prior to recruitment were enrolled between May 2008 and March 2010. Participants who tested HIV positive had a blood draw for CD4. Late HIV diagnosis was defined as CD4≤250 cells/mm. Predictors of late HIV diagnosis were analyzed using multi-variable logistic regression.\n",
      "Of 1966 participants, 616 (31.3%) were HIV infected; 47.6% of these (291) had CD4 counts ≤250. Overall, 66.7% (408) of the HIV infected participants had never received care in a medical clinic. Receiving care in a non-medical setting (home, traditional healer and drug stores) had a threefold increase in the odds of late diagnosis (OR = 3.2; 95%CI: 2.1-4.9) compared to receiving no health care.\n",
      "Late HIV diagnosis remains prevalent five years after introducing provider-initiated HIV testing in Uganda. Many individuals diagnosed with advanced HIV did not have prior exposure to medical clinics and could not have benefitted from the expansion of provider initiated HIV testing within health facilities. In addition to provider-initiated testing, approaches that reach individuals using non-hospital based encounters should be expanded to ensure early HIV diagnosis.\n",
      "In various studies globally, the prevalence of anemia in persons with HIV infection range from 10 to 20% at initial presentation, and anemia is diagnosed in 70 to 80% of these patients over the course of HIV disease. The etiology of anemia in this group of patients has not been fully established, thus a need to evaluate the role of plasma folate as a possible etiological factor.\n",
      "This study was set to determine plasma folate levels in newly diagnosed, treatment naïve, HIV-positive patients, and relate this to other hematological changes.\n",
      "A total of 200 participants were recruited for this study, of which 100 were HIV positive, treatment naive patients who were recruited at the point of registration and 100 were HIV-negative subjects (controls). 5 ml of venous blood was collected and plasma extracted for folic acid estimation by HPLC. A full blood count, CD4 and Viral load were estimated.\n",
      "Mean ages for control and study group were 38 ± 2.3 and 32 ± 1.7 years, respectively. Mean plasma folate concentration among the study group (5.04 μg/l) was significantly lower than that for the control group (15.89 μg/l; P = 0.0002). Prevalence of anemia among the study group was 72% (144 of 200), with a mean hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 9.5 g/dl compared with mean Hb of 13.0 g/dl among the control group (P = 0.002). Plasma folate correlated positively with CD4 cell count (r = 0.304, P<0.05) and inversely with the viral load (r = -0.566; P<0.05).\n",

      "As part of an ongoing study of early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in sub-Saharan African countries, we have identified 134 seroconverters (SCs) with distinct acute-phase (peak) and early chronic-phase (set-point) viremias. SCs with class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants B*44 and B*57 had much lower peak viral loads (VLs) than SCs without these variants (adjusted linear regression beta values of -1.08 ± 0.26 log(10) [mean ± standard error] and -0.83 ± 0.27 log(10), respectively; P < 0.005 for both), after accounting for several nongenetic factors, including gender, age at estimated date of infection, duration of infection, and country of origin. These findings were confirmed by alternative models in which major viral subtypes (A1, C, and others) in the same SCs replaced country of origin as a covariate (P ≤ 0.03). Both B*44 and B*57 were also highly favorable (P ≤ 0.03) in analyses of set-point VLs. Moreover, B*44 was associated with relatively high CD4(+) T-cell counts during early chronic infection (P = 0.02). Thus, at least two common HLA-B variants showed strong influences on acute-phase as well as early chronic-phase VL, regardless of the infecting viral subtype. If confirmed, the identification of B*44 as another favorable marker in primary HIV-1 infection should help dissect mechanisms of early immune protection against HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the survival of HIV-infected children has not been well quantified. Because most pediatric HIV occurs in low- and middle-income countries, our objective was to provide a first estimate of this effect among children living in a resource-deprived setting.\n",
      "Observational data from HAART-naïve children enrolled into an HIV care and treatment program in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, between December 2004 and May 2010 were analyzed. We used marginal structural models to estimate the effect of HAART on survival while accounting for time-dependent confounders affected by exposure. At the start of follow-up, the median age of the 790 children was 5.9 y, 528 (66.8%) had advanced or severe immunodeficiency, and 405 (51.3%) were in HIV clinical stage 3 or 4. The children were observed for a median of 31.2 mo and contributed a total of 2,089.8 person-years. Eighty children (10.1%) died, 619 (78.4%) initiated HAART, six (0.8%) transferred to a different care provider, and 76 (9.6%) were lost to follow-up. The mortality rate was 3.2 deaths per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-4.2) during receipt of HAART and 6.0 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI 4.1-8.6) during receipt of primary HIV care only. The mortality hazard ratio comparing HAART with no HAART from a marginal structural model was 0.25 (95% CI 0.06-0.95).\n",

      "HIV transmission risk is higher during acute and early HIV infection than it is during chronic infection, but the contribution of early infection to the spread of HIV is controversial. We estimated the contribution of early infection to HIV incidence in Lilongwe, Malawi, and predict the future effect of hypothetical prevention interventions targeted at early infection only, chronic infection only, or both stages.\n",
      "We developed a deterministic mathematical model describing heterosexual HIV transmission, informed by detailed behavioural and viral-load data collected in Lilongwe. We included sexual contact within and outside of steady pairs and divided the infectious period into intervals to allow for changes in transmissibility by infection stage. We used a Bayesian melding approach to fit the model to HIV prevalence data collected between 1987 and 2005 at Lilongwe antenatal clinics. We assessed interventions that reduced the per-contact transmission probability to 0.00003 in people receiving them, and varied the proportion of individuals receiving the intervention in each stage.\n",
      "We estimated that 38.4% (95% credible interval 18.6-52.3) of HIV transmissions in Lilongwe are attributable to sexual contact with individuals with early infection. Interventions targeted at only early infection substantially reduced HIV prevalence, but did not lead to elimination, even with 100% coverage. Interventions targeted at only chronic infections also reduced HIV prevalence, but coverage levels of 95-99% were needed for the elimination of HIV. In scenarios with less than 95% coverage of interventions targeted at chronic infections, additional interventions reaching 25-75% of individuals with early infection reduced HIV prevalence substantially.\n",
      "Our results suggest that early infection plays an important part in HIV transmission in this sub-Saharan African setting. Without near-complete coverage, interventions during chronic infection will probably have incomplete effectiveness unless complemented by strategies targeting individuals with early HIV infection.\n",

      "Previous quantitative studies suggest a mutually reinforcing relationship between HIV counselling and testing (HCT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HCT is the entry into ART, and access to ART appears to increase HIV-testing uptake in settings with historically low uptake. Adopting a qualitative approach, this study examined the influence of ART on willingness to test for HIV, in a rural community in South Africa. Ninety-six in-depth interviews from a large community-based HIV-prevention trial were analysed. The data provide insight into the community members' views, perceptions and experiences regarding ART, and how they draw on these in making decisions about HIV testing. Several key factors that supported a positive relationship between ART and HIV testing were noted. These included the beliefs that ART brings hope and that it prolongs life; the powerful positive effect of witnessing the recovery of someone on treatment; and that ART encourages early HIV-testing behaviour. A few negative factors that could potentially weaken the effects of this positive relationship between ART and HCT uptake were the disclosure difficulties experienced by those enrolled in treatment, beliefs that ART does not cure HIV disease, and the travel distance to testing and treatment facilities from where people live and work. HIV/AIDS-service providers and programme planners should actively draw on these observations, to encourage increased HIV testing in communities and to ensure that the maximum number of people get the HIV treatment and care services that they require.\n",
      "The HIV epidemic in Cameroon is characterized by a high degree of viral genetic diversity with circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) being predominant. The goal of our study was to determine recent trends in virus evolution and emergence of drug resistance in blood donors and HIV positive patients.\n",
      "Blood specimens of 73 individuals were collected from three cities and a few villages in Cameroon and viruses were isolated by co-cultivation with PBMCs. Nested PCR was performed for gag p17 (670 bp) pol (840 bp) and Env gp41 (461 bp) genes. Sequences were phylogenetically analyzed using a reference set of sequences from the Los Alamos database.\n",
      "Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences revealed that 65% (n = 48) of strains were CRF02_AG, 4% (n = 3) subtype F2, 1% each belonged to CRF06 (n = 1), CRF11 (n = 1), subtype G (n = 1), subtype D (n = 1), CRF22_01A1 (n = 1), and 26% (n = 18) were Unique Recombinant Forms (URFs). Most URFs contained CRF02_AG in one or two HIV gene fragments analyzed. Furthermore, pol sequences of 61 viruses revealed drug resistance in 55.5% of patients on therapy and 44% of drug naïve individuals in the RT and protease regions. Overall URFs that had a primary HIV subtype designation in the pol region showed higher HIV-1 p24 levels than other recombinant forms in cell culture based replication kinetics studies.\n",
      "Our results indicate that although CRF02_AG continues to be the predominant strain in Cameroon, phylogenetically the HIV epidemic is continuing to evolve as multiple recombinants of CRF02_AG and URFs were identified in the individuals studied. CRF02_AG recombinants that contained the pol region of a primary subtype showed higher replicative advantage than other variants. Identification of drug resistant strains in drug-naïve patients suggests that these viruses are being transmitted in the population studied. Our findings support the need for continued molecular surveillance in this region of West Central Africa and investigating impact of variants on diagnostics, viral load and drug resistance assays on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "The present study addressed two questions: what fraction of individuals maintain a sustained high HIV-1 RNA load after the acute HIV-1C infection peak and how long is a high HIV-1 RNA load maintained after acute HIV-1C infection in this subpopulation?\n",
      "Plasma HIV-1 RNA dynamics were studied in 77 participants with primary HIV-1C infection from African cohorts in Gaborone, Botswana, and Durban, South Africa. HIV-infected individuals who maintained mean viral load of at least 100,000 (5.0 log(10)) copies/ml after 100 days postseroconversion (p/s) were termed extended high viremics. Individuals were followed longitudinally for a median [interquartile range (IQR)] of 573 (226-986) days p/s.\n",
      "The proportion of extended high viremics was 34% [95% confidence interval (CI) 23-44%] during the period 100-300 days p/s and 19% (95% CI 9-29%) over the period of 200-400 days p/s. The median (IQR) duration of HIV-1 RNA load at least 100,000 copies/ml among extended high viremics was 271 (188-340) days p/s. For the subset with average viral load at least 100,000 copies/ml during 200-400 days p/s, the median (IQR) duration was 318 (282-459) days. The extended high viremics had a significantly shorter time to CD4 cell decline to 350 cells/μl (median: 88 vs. 691 days p/s for those not designated as extended high viremics; P < 0.0001, Gehan-Wilcoxon test).\n",
      "A high proportion of extended high viremics - individuals maintaining high plasma HIV-1 RNA load after acute infection - have been identified during primary HIV-1 subtype C infection. These extended high viremics likely contribute disproportionately to HIV-1 incidence.\n",
      "Acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) may present with symptoms for which urgent healthcare is sought. However, little is known about healthcare seeking around the time of HIV-1 seroconversion in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Review of clinical, counselling, treatment and laboratory records of previously HIV-1 seronegative at-risk adults, followed at monthly or 3-monthly visits, who seroconverted and enrolled in an AHI cohort. All HIV-seronegative plasma samples were tested for p24 antigen (p24) and stored preseroconversion samples for HIV-1 RNA (RNA). Factors associated with malaria treatment while acquiring HIV-1 were evaluated in multiple logistic regression.\n",
      "Sixty men and 12 women (95% of 75 seroconverters) were evaluated, including 43 (60%) with either p24-positive or RNA-positive or HIV-1 discordant rapid antibodies prior to seroconversion. Prior to diagnosis, 54 patients (75%) reported fever and 50 (69%) sought urgent care for symptomatic illness, including 23 (32%) who sought care in a nonresearch setting. Twenty-nine patients (40%) received presumptive malaria treatment. Only 24% of febrile patients were tested for malaria parasites. All documented smear results were negative. Malaria treatment was strongly associated with fever [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3-725] and nonresearch setting (aOR: 5, 95% CI: 3-64). AHI was suspected in six (12%) patients who presented for urgent care during research evaluation.\n",
      "The majority of adults with AHI seek urgent healthcare. These individuals are often presumptively treated for malaria. Improved recognition of AHI in adults presenting for care may offer opportunities for optimizing HIV prevention strategies.\n",
      "The BED assay was developed to estimate the proportion of recent HIV infections in a population. We used the BED assay as a proxy for acute infection to quantify the associated risk of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) during pregnancy and delivery. Design A total of 3773 HIV-1 sero-positive women were tested within 96 h of delivery using the BED assay, and CD4 cell count measurements were taken. Mothers were classified according to their likelihood of having recently seroconverted.\n",
      "The risk of MTCT in utero and intra-partum was assessed comparing different groups defined by BED and CD4 cell count, adjusting for background factors using multinomial logistic models.\n",
      "Compared with women with BED ≥ 0.8/CD4 ≥ 350 (typical of HIV-1 chronic patients) there was insufficient evidence to conclude that women presenting with BED < 0.8/CD4 ≥ 350 (typical of recent infections) were more likely to transmit in utero [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.37, 96% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-2.08, P = 0.14], whereas women with BED < 0.8/CD4 200-349 (possibly recently infected patients) had a 2.57 (95% CI 1.39-4.77, P-value < 0.01) odds of transmitting in utero. Women who had BED < 0.8/CD4 < 200 were most likely to transmit in utero (aOR 3.73, 95% CI 1.27-10.96, P = 0.02). BED and CD4 cell count were not predictive of intra-partum infections.\n",
      "These data provide evidence that in utero transmission of HIV might be higher among women who seroconvert during pregnancy.\n",
      "The burden of paediatric HIV infection remains high in resource-poor settings. Information on morbidity leading to hospitalisation as well as outcome is limited.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to determine the reasons for hospital admissions of HIV-infected paediatric patients to a tertiary teaching hospital and the outcome of these admissions.\n",
      "Retrospective chart review of inpatient records of all HIV-infected children aged 0 to 13 years admitted to the paediatric unit at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital from 30 June 2007 to 30 June 2008 was performed. Abstracted data included age, gender, weight, presenting conditions, diagnosis, duration of hospitalisation, antiretroviral treatment, and outcome.\n",
      "A total of 102 admissions occurred among 76 children. The mean age of the children was 4.5 ± 3.79 years and 42 (55%) were males. HIV diagnosis was made during hospitalisation in 23 (30%) of the 76 patients. Overall, 55 (64%) of the 76 patients had a weight for age less than second percentile and 67% were not on antiretroviral therapy at time of admission. Of the 102 admissions, the predominant diagnosis included pneumonia (40%), gastroenteritis (24%), pulmonary tuberculosis (22%), and/or malaria (19%). Death occurred in 12 of the 102 admissions. Age, gender, and admitting diagnosis were not associated with death.\n",
      "Failure to thrive and common prevalent infections were the predominant reasons for hospitalisation for paediatric HIV/AIDS patients in Accra. Hospitalisations with these conditions should prompt early HIV testing. Efforts should be intensified to prevent maternal to child transmission of HIV infection.\n",
      "Individuals who acquire human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may experience an immediate disruption of genital tract immunity, altering the ability to mount a local and effective immune response. This study examined the impact of early HIV infection on new detection of human papillomavirus (HPV).\n",
      "One hundred fifty-five Zimbabwean women with observation periods before and after HIV acquisition and 486 HIV-uninfected women were selected from a cohort study evaluating hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV acquisition. Study visits occurred at 3-month intervals. Cervical swab samples available from up to 6 months before, at, and up to 6 months after the visit when HIV was first detected were typed for 37 HPV genotypes or subtypes.\n",
      "We observed ∼5-fold higher odds of multiple (≥2) new HPV detections only after HIV acquisition, relative to HIV-negative women after adjusting for sexual behavior and concurrent genital tract infections. We also observed ∼2.5-fold higher odds of single new HPV detections at visits before and after HIV acquisition, relative to HIV-uninfected women in multivariable models.\n",
      "These findings suggest that HIV infection has an immediate impact on genital tract immunity, as evidenced by the high risk of multiple new HPV detections immediately after HIV acquisition.\n",
      "Although highly effective prevention interventions exist, the epidemic of paediatric HIV continues to challenge control efforts in resource-limited settings. We reviewed the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This article presents syntheses of evidence on the costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of HIV MTCT strategies for LMICs from the published literature and evaluates their implications for policy and future research.\n",
      "Candidate studies were identified through a comprehensive database search including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and EconLit restricted by language (English or French), date (January 1st, 1994 to January 17th, 2011) and article type (original research). Articles reporting full economic evaluations of interventions to prevent or reduce HIV MTCT were eligible for inclusion. We searched article bibliographies to identify additional studies. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data from studies retained for review. Study quality was appraised using a modified BMJ checklist for economic evaluations. Data were synthesised in narrative form.\n",
      "We identified 19 articles published in 9 journals from 1996 to 2010, 16 concerning sub-Saharan Africa. Collectively, the articles suggest that interventions to prevent paediatric infections are cost-effective in a variety of LMIC settings as measured against accepted international benchmarks. In concentrated epidemics where HIV prevalence in the general population is very low, MTCT strategies based on universal testing of pregnant women may not compare well against cost-effectiveness benchmarks, or may satisfy formal criteria for cost-effectiveness but offer a low relative value as compared to competing interventions to improve population health.\n",
      "Interventions to prevent HIV MTCT are compelling on economic grounds in many resource-limited settings and should remain at the forefront of global HIV prevention efforts. Future cost-effectiveness analyses can help to ensure that pMTCT interventions for LMICs reach their full potential by focussing on unanswered questions in four areas: local assessment of rapidly evolving HIV MTCT options; strategies to improve coverage and reach underserved populations; evaluation of a more comprehensive set of MTCT approaches including primary HIV prevention and reproductive counselling; integration of HIV MTCT and other sexual and reproductive health services.\n",
      "HLA class I-mediated selection of immune escape mutations in functionally important Gag epitopes may partly explain slower disease progression in HIV-1-infected individuals with protective HLA alleles. To investigate the impact of Gag function on disease progression, the replication capacities of viruses encoding Gag-protease from 60 individuals in early HIV-1 subtype C infection were assayed in an HIV-1-inducible green fluorescent protein reporter cell line and were correlated with subsequent disease progression. Replication capacities did not correlate with viral load set points (P = 0.37) but were significantly lower in individuals with below-median viral load set points (P = 0.03), and there was a trend of correlation between lower replication capacities and lower rates of CD4 decline (P = 0.09). Overall, the proportion of host HLA-specific Gag polymorphisms in or adjacent to epitopes was negatively associated with replication capacities (P = 0.04), but host HLA-B-specific polymorphisms were associated with higher viral load set points (P = 0.01). Further, polymorphisms associated with host-specific protective HLA alleles were linked with higher viral load set points (P = 0.03). These data suggest that transmission or early HLA-driven selection of Gag polymorphisms results in reduced early cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses and higher viral load set points. In support of the former, 46% of individuals with nonprotective alleles harbored a Gag polymorphism exclusively associated with a protective HLA allele, indicating a high rate of their transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, HIV disease progression is likely to be affected by the ability to mount effective Gag CTL responses as well as the replication capacity of the transmitted virus.\n",
      "To substantiate reports of greater emergence of the K65R nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C, we examined natural low-level K65R expression in subtype C relative to subtypes B and AE. We used allele-specific polymerase chain reaction to screen HIV-1 amplified by reverse-transcription high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction from subtype C-infected South African women and infants and CRF01(subtype AE) from Thailand; all subjects were NRTI naive. We found low-level K65R of unknown clinical significance in NRTI-naive subtype C-infected women and infants at frequencies above the natural occurrence in subtypes B and AE. The frequent appearance of subtype C frameshift deletions at codon 65 supports a propensity for transcription error in this region.\n",

Tests for high-risk HPV DNA and cytology were performed on cervical samples, and a colposcopy/biopsy was performed at each visit. The effects of early HIV infection on the risk of HPV infection and HPV-related disease were evaluated.\n",
      "Among seroconverters, HPV infection prevalence was 20.3% before seroconversion, 23.6% at seroconversion (P = .4), and 49.1% after seroconversion (P = .01). Seroconverters had significantly lower HPV infection prevalence than women with prevalent HIV infection before and at seroconversion (41.8% and 45.9%, respectively) but had similar HPV infection prevalence to women with prevalent HIV infection after seroconversion (49.4%). HIV seroconversion was associated with newly detected HPV infection (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 4.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.26-7.13) and increased risk of low-grade cytological abnormalities (AHR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.16-5.51) compared with HIV-negative women.\n",

      "Among mothers who tested HIV positive at baseline and whose infant tested HIV negative with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at six weeks (n=2870), breastfeeding associated transmission was responsible for an average of 8.96 infant infections per 100 child years of breast feeding (95% CI 7.92 to 10.14) and varied little over the breastfeeding period. Breastfeeding associated transmission for mothers who seroconverted postnatally (n=334) averaged 34.56 infant infections per 100 child years (95% CI 26.60 to 44.91) during the first nine months after maternal infection, declined to 9.50 (95% CI 3.07 to 29.47) during the next three months, and was zero thereafter. Among women who seroconverted postnatally and in whom the precise timing of infection was known (≤90 days between last negative and first positive test; n=51), 62% (8/13) of transmissions occurred in the first three months after maternal infection and breastfeeding associated transmission was 4.6 times higher than in mothers who tested HIV positive at baseline and whose infant tested HIV negative with PCR at six weeks. Median plasma HIV concentration in all mothers who seroconverted postnatally declined from 5.0 log(10) copies/mL at the last negative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to 4.1 log(10) copies/mL at 9-12 months after infection. Breast milk HIV load in this group was 4.3 log(10) copies/mL 0-30 days after infection, but rapidly declined to 2.0 log(10) copies/mL and <1.5 log(10) copies/mL by 31-90 days and more than 90 days, respectively. Among women whose plasma sample collected soon after delivery tested negative for HIV with ELISA but positive with PCR (n=17), 75% of their infants were infected or had died by 12 months. An estimated 18.6% to 20.4% of all breastfeeding associated transmission observed in the ZVITAMBO trial occurred among mothers who seroconverted postnatally.\n",
      "Breastfeeding associated transmission is high during primary maternal HIV infection and is mirrored by a high but transient peak in breast milk HIV load. Around two thirds of breastfeeding associated transmission by women who seroconvert postnatally may occur while the mother is still in the \"window period\" of an antibody based test, when she would test HIV negative using one of these tests.

      "This article compares Ghanaian and Zambian church mobilisation on HIV and AIDS. It analyses why long-term interest in HIV and AIDS has declined in Ghana but increased in Zambia, and why church involvement in promoting access to HIV/AIDS treatment has been less apparent in Ghana than in Zambia. The article uses three levels of analysis - society, state, and international - to explicate these different patterns. The analysis finds that continued HIV/AIDS stigma hampered Ghanaian church activities, while a decline in stigma opened up space for church-related HIV/AIDS responses in Zambia. The elite and professional nature of Ghana's churches promoted early HIV/ AIDS activities, but may have prevented these activities from responding to the needs of people with HIV or AIDS. Overlapping personal networks between civil society and state elites in Ghana urged early HIV/AIDS church-related actions, while state co-optation and civil-society divisions in Zambia limited early HIV/AIDS activities. As Zambian churches built ties to external actors, however, they gained autonomy in their HIV/AIDS responses. In contrast, the fact that Ghana was less incorporated into global HIV/AIDS responses (particularly, the global treatment movement) weakened the long-term interest in HIV and AIDS among the country's churches. The article is based on more than 50 semi-structured interviews with a range of participants affiliated with HIV/AIDS organisations (e.g. church, secular, government, donor) in Zambia and Ghana.\n",
      "Early HIV infant diagnosis and treatment have been shown to dramatically improve survival in infants. Despite these findings, infants accessing HIV diagnosis and treatment remain low in Uganda.

      "Pregnant women identified as HIV infected in the Mulago antenatal clinics received one of the following regimens: short-course ARV prophylaxis plus single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) in labor, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), or sdNVP if they presented in labor. Infants received sdNVP and zidovudine (ZDV) for 1 week. Infants HIV diagnosis was done from 6 weeks after delivery.\n",
      "62.3% of HIV-infected women received combination ARVs, including HAART. Early infection rates were highest among infants with no maternal ARV [36.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 17.2 to 59.3] or only sdNVP (11.2; 95% CI: 8.1 to 14.8). Similar rates were observed for the group that took short-course ARVs, ZDV/sdNVP (4.6; 95% CI: 3.2 to 6.4), and ZDV/lamivudine/sdNVP (4.9; 95% CI: 3.1 to 7.2) and lowest rates for those that took HAART (1.7: 95% CI: 0.8 to 2.8). Overall infection rate was 5.0% (95% CI: 4.1 to 5.9).\n",

      "The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as \"early virological controllers\"(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as \"late virological controllers\"(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts.\n",
      "To characterize WHO-defined transmitted HIV drug resistance mutation (TDRM) data from recently HIV-infected African volunteers, we sequenced HIV (pol) and evaluated for TDRM the earliest available specimens from ARV-naive volunteers diagnosed within 1 year of their estimated date of infection at eight research centers in sub-Saharan Africa. TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available; 3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices, and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission.\n",
      "Type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of the tripartite interaction motif (TRIM) family of E3 ligases, but the contribution of these antiviral factors to HIV pathogenesis is not completely understood. We hypothesized that the increased expression of select type 1 IFN and TRIM isoforms is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of HIV-1 acquisition and viral control during primary HIV-1 infection. We measured IFN-α, IFN-β, myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α), and TRIM22 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high-risk, HIV-1-uninfected participants and HIV-1-positive study participants. Samples were available for 32 uninfected subjects and 28 infected persons, all within 1 year of infection. HIV-1-positive participants had higher levels of IFN-β (P = 0.0005), MxA (P = 0.007), and TRIM22 (P = 0.01) and lower levels of huTRIM5α (P < 0.001) than did HIV-1-negative participants. TRIM22 but not huTRIM5α correlated positively with type 1 IFN (IFN-α, IFN-β, and MxA) (all P < 0.0001). In a multivariate model, increased MxA expression showed a significant positive association with viral load (P = 0.0418). Furthermore, TRIM22 but not huTRIM5α, IFN-α, IFN-β, or MxA showed a negative correlation with plasma viral load (P = 0.0307) and a positive correlation with CD4(+) T-cell counts (P = 0.0281). In vitro studies revealed that HIV infection induced TRIM22 expression in PBMCs obtained from HIV-negative donors. Stable TRIM22 knockdown resulted in increased HIV-1 particle release and replication in Jurkat reporter cells. Collectively, these data suggest concordance between type 1 IFN and TRIM22 but not huTRIM5α expression in PBMCs and that TRIM22 likely acts as an antiviral effector in vivo.\n",
      "Understanding sexual behavior following diagnosis of acute HIV infection (AHI) is key to developing prevention programs targeting individuals diagnosed with AHI. We conducted separate qualitative and quantitative interviews with individuals newly diagnosed (n = 19) with AHI at 1-, 4- and 12-weeks post-diagnosis and one qualitative interview with individuals who had previously been diagnosed with AHI (n = 18) in Lilongwe, Malawi and Johannesburg, South Africa between October 2007 and June 2008. The majority of participants reported engaging in sexual activity following diagnosis with AHI with a significant minority reporting unprotected sex during this time. Most participants perceived to have changed their behavior following diagnosis. However, participants reported barriers to condom use and abstinence, in particular, long term relationships and the need for disclosure of sero-status. Understanding of increased infectiousness during AHI was limited. Participants reported a desire for a behavioral intervention at the time of AHI diagnosis, however, there were differences by country in the types of interventions participants found acceptable. Studies are underway to determine the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of interventions designed for individuals with AHI.\n",
      "The combination of long-term concurrent sexual partnerships and high infectiousness early in HIV infection has been suggested as a key driver of the extensive spread of HIV in general populations in sub-Saharan Africa, but this has never been scientifically investigated. We use a mathematical model to simulate HIV spreading on sexual networks with different amounts of concurrency. The models show that if HIV infectiousness is constant over the duration of infection, the amount of concurrency has much less influence on HIV spread compared to when infectiousness varies over three stages of infection with high infectiousness in the first months. The proportion of transmissions during primary infection is sensitive to the amount of concurrency and, in this model, is estimated to be between 16 and 28% in spreading epidemics with increasing concurrency. The sensitivity of epidemic spread to the amount of concurrency is greater than predicted by models that do not include primary HIV infection.\n",
      "Sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicenter of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. However, there is a lack of multicenter data on the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV from blood centers in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "The incidence of HIV infections in the blood donations collected in the main blood banks of five countries (Burkina Faso, Congo, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Senegal) was determined to estimate the current transfusion risk of HIV infection using the incidence rate/window period model.\n",
      "The risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infections associated with the window period varied from 1 in 90,200 donations (Senegal) to 1 in 25,600 (Congo). Considering the five participating blood centers as a whole, the incidence rate of HIV-positive donors per 100,000 person-years was 56.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.1-67.9); the residual risk (RR) was 34.1 (95% CI, 7.8-70.7) per 1 million donations, which represents 1 in 29,000 donations (95% CI, 1/128,000-1/14,000).\n",
      "RR estimates varied according to the country. This is potentially due to a lower incidence of HIV infection in the general population or to a more efficient selection of blood donors in the countries with the lowest risk. The estimates of the transfusion risk of HIV infection in each country are important, both to assess the impact of current preventative strategies and to contribute data to policy decisions to reinforce transfusion safety.\n",
      "HIV/AIDS continues to grow exponentially in sub-Saharan Africa. Early HIV/AIDS care is essential for early interventions to increase quality of life and reduce mortality. The objectives of the study were: (1) to determine the relationship among attitudes, spiritual beliefs, cultural beliefs, social beliefs and knowledge on health-seeking behaviors (HSB) of Gambian adults living with HIV/AIDS; and (2) to provide preliminary data on psychometric characteristics of the newly developed HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Attitudes and Beliefs Patient Questionnaire. The descriptive design included 93 adults aged 21 to 65 years. Correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were used. Bivariate analyses demonstrated significant relationships between all five variables and HSB at p </=.03. Additionally, 11% of the variance in HSB was explained by the combined contribution of the five variables. Attitudes significantly contributed to the variance, F(1, 90) =4.865; p =.03; spiritual beliefs, though not statistically significant, had clinical significance. The unique contributions of this study are the separation of the variable attitudes from beliefs and knowledge, which independently explained HSB. Spiritual beliefs and attitudes are critical in developing appropriate HIV/AIDS interventions. Furthermore, the HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Patient Questionnaire provides a valid means for measuring attitudes, beliefs and knowledge of HIV/AIDS for use in future research.\n",
      "Since 1985, the U.S. Department of Defense has periodically screened all military personnel for HIV allowing for the monitoring of the infection in this dynamic cohort population. A nested case-control study was performed to study sociodemographics, overseas assignment, and molecular analysis of HIV. Cases were newly identified HIV infections among U.S. Army and Air Force military personnel from 2000 to 2004. Controls were frequency matched to cases by gender and date of case first positive HIV screening test. Genotyping analysis was performed using high-throughput screening assays and partial genome sequencing. HIV was significantly associated with black race [odds ratio (OR) = 6.65], single marital status (OR = 4.45), and age (OR per year = 1.07). Ninety-seven percent were subtype B and 3% were non-B subtypes (A3, CRF01_AE, A/C recombinant, G, CRF02_AG). Among cases, overseas assignment in the period at risk prior to their first HIV-positive test was associated with non-B HIV subtype infection (OR = 8.44). Black and single military personnel remain disproportionately affected by HIV infection. Most non-B HIV subtypes were associated with overseas assignment. Given the increased frequency and length of assignments, and the expanding HIV genetic diversity observed in this population, there is a need for active HIV genotyping surveillance and a need to reinforce primary HIV prevention efforts.\n",
      "To identify, diagnose and counsel patients with acute HIV infection (AHI) during routine HIV testing in South Africa.\n",
      "Patients with sexually transmitted infection and clients undergoing voluntary counselling and testing who were negative on rapid HIV antibody tests at a public youth clinic were recruited to the study and tested using HIV-1 PCR and third-generation ELISA. Results were made available at 1 week. Text message reminders and phone calls were employed to encourage patients to return for results. Patients with AHI were additionally visited at home.\n",
      "902 participants were enrolled over the course of 1 year, reporting high levels of sexual risk behaviour, including 66.7% who did not use a condom at last sex. Six (0.67%) were diagnosed with AHI. Results and counselling were delivered to 62.3% of participants and all six patients with AHI.\n",
      "It is possible to perform routine diagnosis and counselling for acute HIV infection in a limited-resource setting. Provider outreach to patients may help in delivering results to a high proportion of patients, but will probably add to the already substantial cost of testing.\n",
      "The frequency of acute HIV infection (AHI) among HIV-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-negative samples received from general hospital patient admissions was assessed. Of 3,005 samples pooled for nucleic acid testing, a prevalence of 0.13% was found. Pooled nucleic acid testing may be feasible for low-cost identification of AHI in high-prevalence settings.\n",
      "Although subtype B strains are still predominant in France, non-B viruses have been isolated from 26% of patients with a primary HIV-1 infection in 2005-2006. The objective of this study was to characterize recombinant-HIV-1 strains by a subtyping based on the phylogenetic analysis of both pol and env sequences. We studied 591 patients who were part of the French PRIMO-Cohort between 1997 and 2007. The RT and V3 regions were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Phylogenetic analyses showed concordant subtype results for 91.7% of viruses: 71.6% of the viruses were subtype B and 28.4% belonged to non-B subtypes or circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Forty-nine strains showed different phylogenies between the two genes (pol and env), indicating that recombinations were observed in 8.3% of the cases. These recombinants were observed in patients from sub-Saharan Africa (28.3%) and in white patients (6.3%). Moreover, among the 49 recombinant viruses, 15 (30.6%) contained a B sequence in the pol or in the env gene compared to 34 (69.4%), which contained non-B or CRF sequences. Twenty-six different recombination patterns involving subtypes, CRFs, or undetermined strains were observed. We have reported the occurrence of new recombinant forms between the two major viral types of strains circulating in France: subtype B and CRF02_AG. Our study confirms a high HIV-1 diversity among patients infected in France within the past 10 years, with a high proportion of non-B strains and the circulation of complex recombinant strains among both sub-Saharan patients and French patients.\n",
      "The yield of screening for acute HIV infection among general medical patients in resource-scarce settings remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the strategy of using pooled HIV plasma RNA to diagnose acute HIV infection in patients with negative or discordant rapid HIV antibody tests in Durban, South Africa.\n",
      "We prospectively enrolled patients with negative or discordant rapid HIV antibody tests from a routine HIV screening programme in an out-patient department in Durban with an HIV prevalence of 48%. Study participants underwent venipuncture for pooled qualitative HIV RNA, and, if this was positive, quantitative RNA, enzyme immunoassay and Western blot (WB). Patients with negative or indeterminate WB and positive quantitative HIV RNA were considered acutely infected. Those with chronic infection (positive RNA and WB) despite negative or discordant rapid HIV tests were considered to have had false negative rapid antibody tests.\n",
      "Nine hundred and ninety-four participants were enrolled with either negative (n=976) or discordant (n=18) rapid test results. Eleven [1.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-2.0%] had acute HIV infection, and an additional 20 (2.0%; 95% CI 1.3-3.1%) had chronic HIV infection (false negative rapid test).\n",
      "One per cent of out-patients with negative or discordant rapid HIV tests in Durban, South Africa had acute HIV infection readily detectable through pooled serum HIV RNA screening. Pooled RNA testing also identified an additional 2% of patients with chronic HIV infection. HIV RNA screening has the potential to identify both acute and chronic HIV infections that are otherwise missed by standard HIV testing algorithms.\n",
      "Acute febrile illnesses consistent with malaria are the most common presentation at health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 30-50% of outpatient visits. The symptoms of acute HIV infection can mimic acute malaria. We investigated whether acute HIV infections could be identified among adults with suspected malaria at rural health centers in Uganda.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study of 1000 consecutive patients referred for malaria blood smears at each of seven government health centers, of which 2893 (41%) were 13 years or older and tested for HIV.\n",
      "HIV enzyme immunoassay antibody testing was performed on dried blood spots and confirmed by western blot. Enzyme immunoassay-nonreactive and enzyme immunoassay-reactive, western blot-unconfirmed samples were pooled (10/pool) and tested for HIV RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing. We defined acute HIV infection as HIV-1 RNA positive with a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 western blot pattern and early HIV infection as HIV-1 RNA positive with a positive western blot pattern, but with a BED-corrected optical density of below 0.8.\n",
      "Of 2893 patients evaluated, 324 (11%) had test results indicating HIV infection. Overall, 30 patients (1.0%) had acute HIV infection, 56 (1.8%) had early HIV infection, and 238 (8%) had established HIV infection. Acute HIV infections were more prevalent at sites with higher HIV prevalence and lower malaria endemicity.\n",
      "At multiple sites in Uganda, 1-3% of adults with suspected malaria had acute or early HIV infection. These findings highlight a major opportunity for expanding recognition of acute and early HIV infection in Africa.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of male circumcision (MC) on HIV acquisition estimated using HIV incidence assays and to compare it to the effect measured by survival analysis.\n",
      "We used samples collected during the MC randomized controlled trial (ANRS-1265) conducted in Orange Farm (South Africa) among men aged 18 to 24. Among the 2946 samples collected at the last follow-up visit, 194 HIV-positive samples were tested using two incidence assays: Calypte HIV-EIA (BED) and an avidity assay based on the BioRad HIV1/2+O EIA (AI). The results of the assays were also combined (BED-AI). The samples included the 124 participants (4.2% of total) who were HIV-positive at randomization. The protective effect was calculated as one minus the intention-to-treat incidence rate ratio in an uncorrected manner and with correction for misclassifications, with simple theoretical formulae. Theoretical calculations showed that the uncorrected intention-to-treat effect was approximately independent of the value of the incidence assay window period and was the ratio of the number tested recent seroconverters divided by the number tested HIV-negative between the randomization groups. We used cut-off values ranging from 0.325 to 2.27 for BED, 31.6 to 96 for AI and 0.325-31.6 to 1.89-96 for BED-AI. Effects were corrected for long-term specificity using a previously published formula. 95% Confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by bootstrap resampling.\n",
      "With the highest cut-off values, the uncorrected protective effects evaluated by BED, AI and BED-AI were 50% (95%CI: 27% to 66%), 50% (21% to 69%) and 63% (36% to 81%). The corrections for misclassifications were lower than 50% of the number of tested recent. The corrected effects were 53% (30% to 70%), 55% (25% to 77%) and 67% (38% to 86%), slightly higher than the corresponding uncorrected values. These values were consistent with the previously reported protective effect of 60% (34% to 76%) obtained with survival analysis.\n",
      "HIV incidence assays may be employed to assess the effect of interventions using cross-sectional data.\n",
      "Following a 1994 study showing a high rate of transfusion-associated HIV, Kenya implemented WHO blood safety recommendations including: organizing the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS), stringent blood donor selection, and universal screening with fourth-generation p24 antigen and HIV antibody assays. Here, we estimate the risk of transfusion-associated HIV transmission in Kenya resulting from NBTS laboratory error and consider the potential safety benefit of instituting pooled nucleic acid testing (NAT) to reduce window period transmission.\n",
      "From November to December 2008 in one NBTS regional centre, and from March to June 2009 in all six NBTS regional centres, every third unit of blood screened negative for HIV by the national algorithm was selected. Dried blood spots were prepared and sent to a reference laboratory for further testing, including NAT. Test results from the reference laboratory and NBTS were compared. Risk of transfusion-associated HIV transmission owing to laboratory error and the estimated yield of implementing NAT were calculated.\n",
      "No cases of laboratory error were detected in 12,435 units tested. We estimate that during the study period, the percentage of units reactive for HIV by NAT but non-reactive by the national algorithm was 0·0% (95% exact binomial confidence interval, 0·00-0·024%).\n",
      "By adopting WHO blood safety strategies for resource-limited settings, Kenya has substantially reduced the risk of transfusion-associated HIV infection. As the national testing and donor selection algorithm is effective, implementing NAT is unlikely to add a significant safety benefit. These findings should encourage other countries in the region to fully adopt the WHO strategies.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the HIV-1 RNA pooled nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) strategy to screen pregnant women in the 'window period' of acute HIV infection (AHI) in rural South Africa.\n",
      "In 2007 and 2008, 750 consecutive pregnant women on their first antenatal care visit to a primary health care clinic were tested anonymously for HIV infection. HIV-1 RNA pooled NAAT was performed on HIV antibody-negative samples. All positive pools were tested individually and positive samples were classified as incident cases to calculate HIV incidence.\n",
      "The overall HIV prevalence was 37.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.3–41.3]. Of the 467 HIV antibody-negative samples, four (0.9%) were HIV-1 RNA-positive. The mean viral load in the four samples was 386 260 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (range 64 200–1 228130). The HIV incidence was 11.2%per year (95% CI 0.3–22.1) and all women with AHI were 21 years of age.\n",
      "Identifying AHI in pregnancy is important for health interventions to reduce perinatal and heterosexual transmission of HIV, and to estimate HIV incidence for epidemiological surveillance.\n",
      "Despite policies, strategies, and guidelines, the epidemic of HIV-associated tuberculosis continues to rage, particularly in southern Africa. We focus our attention on the regions with the greatest burden of disease, especially sub-Saharan Africa, and concentrate on prevention of tuberculosis in people with HIV infection, a challenge that has been greatly neglected. We argue for a much more aggressive approach to early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection in affected communities, and propose urgent assessment of frequent testing for HIV and early start of antiretroviral treatment (ART). This approach should result in short-term and long-term declines in tuberculosis incidence through individual immune reconstitution and reduced HIV transmission. Implementation of the 3Is policy (intensified tuberculosis case finding, infection control, and isoniazid preventive therapy) for prevention of HIV-associated tuberculosis, combined with earlier start of ART, will reduce the burden of tuberculosis in people with HIV infection and provide a safe clinical environment for delivery of ART. Some progress is being made in provision of HIV care to HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis, but too few receive co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and ART. We make practical recommendations about how to improve this situation. Early HIV diagnosis and treatment, the 3Is, and a comprehensive package of HIV care, in association with directly observed therapy, short-course (DOTS) for tuberculosis, form the basis of prevention and control of HIV-associated tuberculosis. This call to action recommends that both HIV and tuberculosis programmes exhort implementation of strategies that are known to be effective, and test innovative strategies that could work. The continuing HIV-associated tuberculosis epidemic needs bold but responsible action, without which the future will simply mirror the past.\n",
      "The progress of antiretroviral treatment roll-out programs in developing countries requires extensive monitoring of primary drug resistance prior to initiation of therapy. This is particularly relevant for Cameroon where a high HIV diversity has been reported.\n",
      "To determine HIV diversity in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in a cohort of HIV-infected subjects with advanced disease. To characterize HIV-1 mutations conferring primary drug resistance and to assess primary resistance patterns in the RNase H domain of the reverse transcriptase of these viruses.\n",
      "HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma of 59 HIV-1 infected, drug-naïve subjects with CD4+ T-cell counts<200/microl. HIV-1 pol (PR, RT and RNase H) regions were sequenced for subtyping and for identifying drug resistance mutations in pol (PR, RT and RNase H).\n",
      "A complex HIV-1 diversity was seen, with multiple subtypes (A1, A2, C, D, F2, H, group O), CRFs (02_AG, 09_cpx, 11_cpx, 13_cpx, 22_01A1, 30_0206, 43_02G) and URFs. Primary drug resistance was low in PR (2%) and in RT regions (4%). RNase H mutations Q509L and Q547K were found in non-CRF02_AG strains.\n",
      "A high HIV-1 diversity was already present in Cameroon in the early 90s, when the subjects were likely infected. Primary HIV-1 drug resistance was low. Occurrence of RNase H mutations with proven phenotypic effect on susceptibility to antiretrovirals encourages further assessment of their impact in treatment outcome in the context of complex HIV genetic diversity and in a subtype-specific fashion.\n",
      "Multidrug antiretroviral (ARV) regimens including HAART and short-course dual antiretroviral (sc-dARV) regimens were introduced in 2004 to improve Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) in Cameroon. We assessed the effectiveness of these regimens from 6-10 weeks and 12 months of age, respectively.\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective cohort study covering the period from October 2004 to March 2008 in a reference hospital in Cameroon. HIV-positive pregnant women with CD4 < or = 350 cells/mm(3) received first-line HAART [regimen 1] while the others received ARV prophylaxis including sc-dARV or single dose nevirapine (sd-NVP). Sc-dARV included at least two drugs according to different gestational ages: zidovudine (ZDV) from 28-32 weeks plus sd-NVP [regimen 2], ZDV and lamuvidine (3TC) from 33-36 weeks plus sd-NVP [regimen 3]. When gestational age was > or = 37 weeks, women received sd-NVP during labour [regimen 4]. Infants received sd-NVP plus ZDV and 3TC for 7 days or 30 days. Early diagnosis (6-10 weeks) was done, using b-DNA and subsequently RT-PCR. We determined early MTCT rate and associated risk factors using logistic regression. The 12-month HIV-free survival was assessed using Cox regression. Among 418 mothers, 335 (80%) received multidrug ARV regimens (1, 2, and 3) and MTCT rate with multidrug regimens was 6.6% [95%CI: 4.3-9.6] at 6 weeks, without any significant difference between regimens. Duration of mother's ARV regimen < 4 weeks [OR = 4.7, 95%CI: 1.3-17.6], mother's CD4 < 350 cells/mm(3) [OR = 6.4, 95%CI: 1.8-22.5] and low birth weight [OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 1.4-11.3] were associated with early MTCT. By 12 months, mixed feeding [HR = 8.7, 95%CI: 3.6-20.6], prematurity [HR = 2.3, 95%CI: 1.2-4.3] and low birth weight were associated with children's risk of progressing to infection or death.\n",
      "Multidrug ARV regimens for PMTCT are feasible and effective in routine reference hospital. Early initiation of ARV during pregnancy and proper obstetrical care are essential to improve PMTCT.\n",
      "We investigated acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among men enrolled in a genital ulcer treatment trial in South Africa. HIV-negative participants were tested at baseline by HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction and followed up after 1 month to measure HIV seroconversion. There were 228 HIV-negative men at baseline; 10 were positive for HIV RNA, and 8 seroconverted to HIV at day 28. The prevalence of acute HIV among HIV-negative men at baseline was 18 (7.9%) of 228 men (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-11.4) and 18 (2.9%) of 615 men (95% CI, 1.6-4.3) in the overall study population. These data highlight the importance of genital ulcer patients in HIV transmission. Trial Registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00164424 .\n",
      "This study assessed the uptake of provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) among women attending an urban sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in South Africa. From July 2005 to June 2006, women were offered HIV testing following group information and education on HIV and STDs in the clinic waiting area. Of those who were provided with education, information, and offered HIV testing, uptake was 43.5% (2439/5612). The overall HIV prevalence among those tested was 56.5% and the prevalence of acute HIV infection was 1.2%. Of the 56.5% (3173/5612) refusing to test, the reasons for not testing were having already been tested for HIV (61.8%), being afraid to test or felt unready to test (32.5%), the need to consult with partner (0.9%), and refusing with no explanation (4.8%). In settings where high-risk patients await health care services, such as an STD clinic, failure to implement PITC is a missed opportunity for patients to benefit from counseling, prevention, early diagnosis, and referral into care and treatment for HIV infection.\n",
      "The functional integrity of CD4(+) T cells is crucial for well-orchestrated immunity and control of HIV-1 infection, but their selective depletion during infection creates a paradox for understanding a protective response. We used multiparameter flow cytometry to measure activation, memory maturation, and multiple functions of total and Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells in 14 HIV-1- and CMV- coinfected individuals at 3 and 12 mo post HIV-1 infection. Primary HIV-1 infection was characterized by elevated levels of CD38, HLA-DR, and Ki67 in total memory and Gag-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In both HIV-infected and 15 uninfected controls, the frequency of activated cells was uniformly distributed among early differentiated (ED; CD45RO(+)CD27(+)), late differentiated (CD45RO(+)CD27(-)), and fully differentiated effector (CD45RO(-)CD27(-)) memory CD4(+) T cells. In HIV-1-infected individuals, activated CD4(+) T cells significantly correlated with viremia at 3 mo postinfection (r = 0.79, p = 0.0007) and also harbored more gag provirus DNA copies than nonactivated cells (p = 0.04). Moreover, Gag-specific ED CD4(+) T cells inversely associated with plasma viral load (r = -0.87, p < 0.0001). Overall, we show that low copy numbers of gag provirus and plasma RNA copies associated with low CD4 activation as well as accumulation of ED HIV-specific CD4(+) memory. Significant positive correlations between 3 and 12 mo activation and memory events highlighted that a steady state of CD4(+) T cell activation and memory maturation was established during primary infection and that these cells were unlikely to be involved in influencing the course of viremia in the first 12 mo of HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "There are limited data on acute HIV infection (AHI) prevalence during pregnancy. Malawian pregnant women admitted in the third trimester and meeting eligibility criteria underwent dual HIV rapid antibody testing. AHI prevalence was retrospectively detected through HIV RNA pooling of seronegative plasma. Among 3,825 pregnant women screened, dual HIV rapid testing indicated that 30.2% were HIV positive, 69.7% were HIV negative, and 0.1% were indeterminate. Sensitivity and specificity of dual rapid testing was 99.0% and 98.7%, respectively. Of 2,666 seronegative specimens, 2,327 had samples available for HIV RNA pooling; 5 women (0.21%) (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.40%) had AHI with a median peripartum viral load of 1,324,766 copies/mL. Pregnant women are at risk for AHI, warranting counseling of all women and their sexual partners about incident HIV during pregnancy. Dual HIV rapid tests have high sensitivity and specificity. HIV testing should be repeated in the third trimester and/or at delivery.\n",
      "Both T-cell activation during early HIV-1 infection and soluble markers of immune activation during chronic infection are predictive of HIV disease progression. Although the acute phase of HIV infection is associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, the relationship between cytokine concentrations and HIV pathogenesis is unknown.\n",

      "Study including 40 South African women who became infected with HIV-1 and were followed longitudinally from the time of infection.\n",
      "The concentrations of 30 cytokines in plasma from women with acute HIV-1 infection were measured and associations between cytokine levels and both viral load set point 12 months postinfection and time taken for CD4 cell counts to fall below 350 cells/microl were determined using multivariate and Cox proportional hazards regression.\n",
      "We found that the concentrations of five plasma cytokines, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, IL-7 and IL-15 in women with acute infection predicted 66% of the variation in viral load set point 12 months postinfection. IL-12p40, IL-12p70 and IFN-gamma were significantly associated with lower viral load, whereas IL-7 and IL-15 were associated with higher viral load. Plasma concentrations of IL-12p40 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor during acute infection were associated with maintenance of CD4 cell counts above 350 cells/microl, whereas IL-1alpha, eotaxin and IL-7 were associated with more rapid CD4 loss.\n",

      "Numerous national public initiatives offering first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV infection have commenced in sub-Saharan Africa since 2002. Presently, 2.1 million of an estimated seven million Africans in need of cART are receiving treatment. Analyses from the region report favorable clinical/treatment outcomes and impressive declines in AIDS-related mortality among HIV-1-infected adults and children receiving cART. While immunologic recovery, virologic suppression and cART adherence rates are on par with resource-rich settings, loss to follow-up and high mortality rates, especially within the first 6 months of treatment, remain a significant problem. Over the next decade, cART coverage rates are expected to improve across the region, with attendant increases in healthcare utilization for HIV- and non-HIV-related complications and the need for expanded laboratory and clinical services. Planned and in-progress trials will evaluate the use of cART to prevent primary HIV-1 infection with so-called 'test and treat' expansions of coverage and treatment. Education and training programs as well as patient-retention strategies will need to be strengthened as national cART programs are expanded and more people require lifelong monitoring and care.\n",

      "We estimated the mean HIV-1 plasma setpoint to be 4.20 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.04-4.35] at 121 days (95% CI 91-137) from infection; an analogous mean cervical viral setpoint was 1.64 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/swab (95% CI 1.46-1.82) at 174 days (95% CI 145-194) from infection. Cervical loads were significantly higher (0.7-1.1 log10 copies/swab) during acute infection than subsequently. Subtype D infection, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and older age at the time of infection were associated with higher plasma viral setpoint. Subtype C infection, nonviral sexually transmitted infections, having a partner spending nights away from home, recent unprotected sex, and shorter time since infection were associated with higher cervical HIV-1 loads. Hormonal contraception was not associated with either the HIV-1 plasma setpoint or cervical loads during early infection.\n",
      "Cervical HIV-1 viral loads were highest during acute infection and then declined up to 6 months following infection, when a 'setpoint' was attained. The prognostic value of a cervical 'setpoint' on future transmission risk remains unclear.\n",
      "We previously described the polymorphism in the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene as a novel correlate of resistance to HIV-1 infection in a Kenyan female sex worker cohort. However, the underlying mechanisms likely mediating this association remained to be elucidated. The initiation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects with different IRF-1 haplotypes, representing protective, intermediate and the least protective IRF-1 allele combinations, were investigated here. A single-cycle pseudovirus construct expressing vesicular stomatitis virus envelop G-protein (VSV-G) and having an HIV-1 pNL4.3 backbone with luciferase insert was used to infect PBMCs with different IRF-1 haplotypes. The efficiency of early HIV-1 LTR transcription was monitored using a luciferase assay. IRF-1 protein levels induced by the infection were measured by quantitative Western blot. Our results showed that PBMCs with the protective IRF-1 genotype demonstrated significantly lower HIV-1 LTR transcription during the initial stages of infection compared to PBMCs with other haplotypes, which correlated with the kinetics of IRF-1 responsiveness to HIV-1 infection in the cells. It suggests that IRF-1 genotypes alter the efficiency of early HIV-1 LTR transcription, likely via modulating expression of IRF-1. This may represent one mechanism mediating the association between IRF-1 polymorphisms and resistance to HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "We sought to study the survival of newborn children according to HIV status of the mother, that of the child and the timing of infection.\n",
      "This is a prospective cohort study of 883 mothers (665 HIV-positive and 218 HIV-negative) and their infants. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires during home visits between the antenatal period and 36 weeks post-delivery. Infant HIV status was determined at 3, 24 and 36 weeks by HIV DNA PCR.\n",
      "The majority (81.3%) of infected infants who died were infected by 3 weeks of age. Of the HIV-exposed infants who died, 19 (28.4%) died before 6 weeks and 38 (56.7%) died by 12 weeks. The hazard ratio (HR) of mortality at 36 weeks of age in HIV-infected infants compared with exposed but negative infants was 8.9 (95% CI: 6.7-11.8). There was no significant difference in 36 week survival rates between HIV-non-exposed and HIV-exposed but negative infants (HR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3-1.5). The infant being HIV-positive at age 3 weeks (HR: 32 95% CI: 14.0-73.1) and rural site (HR: 4.4 95% CI: 1.2-23.4) were the two independent risk factors for infant death amongst HIV-exposed infants.\n",
      "The prognosis for infants with early HIV infection was very poor in this cohort. A greater focus on prevention of early infection, earlier screening for HIV infection and access to antiretrovirals for eligible infants is recommended.\n",
      "It has long been known that autologous neutralizing antibodies (AnAbs) exert pressure on the envelope of HIV, resulting in neutralization escape. However, recently, progress has been made in uncovering the precise targets of these potent early antibodies.\n",
      "AnAbs primarily target variable regions of the HIV-1 envelope, explaining the strain-specificity of these antibodies. Despite high neutralizing potential and cross-reactivity, anti-V3 antibodies do not contribute to autologous neutralization. The V1V2 is commonly immunogenic in early HIV-1 and simian human immunodeficiency virus infections, though the nature of these epitopes remains to be determined. In subtype C viruses, the C3 region is a neutralization target, possibly as a result of its more exposed and amphipathic structure. Autologous neutralization appears to be mediated by very few AnAb specificities that develop sequentially suggesting the possibility of immunological hierarchies for both binding and neutralizing antibodies. The role of AnAbs in preventing superinfection and in restricting virus replication is reexamined in the context of recent data.\n",
      "New studies have greatly contributed toward our understanding of the specificities mediating autologous neutralization and highlighted potential vulnerabilities on transmitted viruses. However, the contribution of AnAbs to the development of neutralization breadth remains to be characterized.\n",
      "To determine the prevalence of acute HIV infection (AHI) within the HIV-seronegative adult population presenting with reported fever in a district hospital in southern Mozambique and evaluate clinical, immunological and virological parameters of AHI.\n",
      "This is a prospective observational study.\n",
      "Three hundred and forty-six adults presenting with reported fever at an outpatient ward at the Manhiça District Hospital in Mozambique were screened for AHI by HIV rapid serology testing, followed by HIV-RNA testing in HIV-seronegative individuals. Plasma from HIV-seronegative patients was pooled in the ratio of 1: 5 for HIV-RNA testing. Whole blood was used for Plasmodium falciparum rapid test determination at screening visit. Follow-up visits at day 7, 4 and 10 months included clinical examination, HIV serotesting and assessment of HIV-RNA, CD4 cell counts and percentage of activated CD8 T cells.\n",
      "HIV serotesting revealed that 37.8% (95% confidence interval 32.7-43.2) of the adults had previously undiagnosed established HIV infection. Among the HIV-seronegative patients, 3.3% (95% confidence interval 1.3-6.7) were found to have AHI as demonstrated by positive HIV-1 RNA testing. Median HIV-1 RNA levels at diagnosis of AHI were 6.21 log10 copies/ml (interquartile range 5.92-6.41) and significantly higher than median HIV-RNA load at 4 months. At day 7 after screening, patients showed a median CD4 cell count of 384 cells/microl (interquartile range 239-441) and a median percentage of activated CD8 T cells of 68.4% (interquartile range 59.6-87.8).\n",
      "Of patients reporting with fever, 3.3% were shown to be potentially due to AHI. High prevalence of AHI in southern African populations may warrant investigation of tools and target populations for AHI screening as a novel way to address HIV prevention.\n",
      "Abstract In this study, we characterized four HIV-1 strains from Cameroon, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), collected during independent serosurveys, and previously found to cluster in the pol gene with HIV-1 MAL and HIV-1 NOGIL3, two complex recombinant viruses reported in the early HIV epidemic, and with the recombinant strain 04FR.AUK recently described in France. The four newly sequenced viruses shared the same structure as 04FR.AUK, involving alternating fragments of subtype A, K, and unclassified (U) fragments, representing a new CRF called CRF45_AKU. Some of the unclassified fragments were related to unclassified regions described in either CRF04 or CRF09 strains. Careful reanalysis of HIV-1 MAL and HIV-1 NOGIL3 demonstrated that these strains were related exclusively to CRF45_AKU and either two subtype D fragments for HIV-1 MAL or one subtype H segment for HIV-1 NOGIL3. Following extensive blast searches, related gag, pol, and env sequences were observed in Central and West Africa (Senegal, Mali), as well as in Europe (France, Spain, Italy, Cyprus), Argentina, and China.\n",
      "In the absence of HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif), cellular cytosine deaminases such as apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) inhibit the virus by inducing hypermutations on viral DNA, among other mechanisms of action. We investigated the association of APOBEC3G mRNA levels and genetic variants on HIV-1 susceptibility, and early disease pathogenesis using viral load and CD4 T-cell counts as outcomes.\n",
      "Study participants were 250 South African women at high risk for HIV-1 subtype C infection. We used real-time PCR to measure the expression of APOBEC3G in HIV-negative and HIV-positive primary infection samples. APOBEC3G variants were identified by DNA re-sequencing and TaqMan genotyping.\n",
      "We found no correlation between APOBEC3G expression levels and plasma viral loads (r = 0.053, P = 0.596) or CD4 T-cell counts (r = 0.030, P = 0.762) in 32 seroconverters. APOBEC3G expression levels were higher in HIV-negative individuals as compared with HIV-positive individuals (P < 0.0001), including matched pre and postinfection samples from the same individuals (n = 13, P < 0.0001). Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms, including eight novel, were identified within APOBEC3G by re-sequencing and genotyping. The H186R mutation, a codon-changing variant in exon 4, and a 3' extragenic mutation (rs35228531) were associated with high viral loads (P = 0.0097 and P < 0.0001) and decreased CD4 T-cell levels (P = 0.0081 and P < 0.0001), respectively.\n",
      "These data suggest that APOBEC3G transcription is rapidly downregulated upon HIV-1 infection. During primary infection, APOBEC3G expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells do not correlate with viral loads or CD4 T-cell counts. Genetic variation of APOBEC3G may significantly affect early HIV-1 pathogenesis, although the mechanism remains unclear and warrants further investigation.\n",
      "Characterization of HIV-1 from slow progressors is important to facilitate vaccine and antiviral drug development. To identify virus attenuations that may contribute to slower rates of disease progression, the full-length viral genomes from primary isolates of six slow progressing HIV-positive children were sequenced. Proviral DNA was extracted from cocultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used to PCR amplify, sequence, and extensively analyze the near full-length genomes and LTR regions. All primary HIV-1 isolates were HIV-1 subtype C throughout their genome, and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis revealed open reading frames for all genes. However, all isolates had at least one unusual gene/protein. For example, isolate LT5 had a 2AA insertion in the Vpr mitochondriotoxic domain. Isolate LT21 contained an additional 5AA in the C-terminus of tat exon 2, while integrase in isolate LT39 had an additional 4AA at the C-terminus. Rev from isolates LT45 and LT46 did not have the characteristic subtype C 16AA truncation, and in addition, had a further 3AA. Furthermore, altered functional domains were noted in several isolates, such as the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA phosphorylation site in Nef (LT5), a Vpr mutation involved in decreased proapoptotic activity (all isolates), and the Nef ExxxLL motif involved in the interaction with AP-1 and AP-2 (LT46). The slower HIV-1 disease progression in these six children may be attributed to altered protein functions. For example, LT46 Nef is unable to bind AP-1 and AP-2 and therefore is inactive on CD4 endocytosis. The biological relevance of these findings requires further investigation.\n",
      "Cross-sectional surveys utilizing biomarkers that test for recent infection provide a convenient and cost effective way to estimate HIV incidence. In particular, the BED assay has been developed for this purpose. Controversy surrounding the way in which false positive results from the biomarker should be handled has lead to a number of different estimators that account for imperfect specificity. We compare the estimators proposed by McDougal et al., Hargrove et al. and McWalter & Welte.\n",
      "The three estimators are analyzed and compared. An identity showing a relationship between the calibration parameters in the McDougal methodology is shown. When the three estimators are tested under a steady state epidemic, which includes individuals who fail to progress on the biomarker, only the McWalter/Welte method recovers an unbiased result.\n",
      "Our analysis shows that the McDougal estimator can be reduced to a formula that only requires calibration of a mean window period and a long-term specificity. This allows simpler calibration techniques to be used and shows that all three estimators can be expressed using the same set of parameters. The McWalter/Welte method is applicable under the least restrictive assumptions and is the least prone to bias of the methods reviewed.\n",
      "We previously showed that HIV-1 subtype C viruses elicit potent but highly type-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAb) within the first year of infection. In order to determine the specificity and evolution of these autologous nAbs, we examined neutralization escape in four individuals whose responses against the earliest envelope differed in magnitude and potency. Neutralization escape occurred in all participants, with later viruses showing decreased sensitivity to contemporaneous sera, although they retained sensitivity to new nAb responses. Early nAb responses were very restricted, occurring sequentially and targeting only two regions of the envelope. In V1V2, limited amino acid changes often involving indels or glycans, mediated partial or complete escape, with nAbs targeting the V1V2 region directly in 2 cases. The alpha-2 helix of C3 was also a nAb target, with neutralization escape associated with changes to positively charged residues. In one individual, relatively high titers of anti-C3 nAbs were required to drive genetic escape, taking up to 7 weeks for the resistant variant to predominate. Thereafter titers waned but were still measurable. Development of this single anti-C3 nAb specificity was associated with a 7-fold drop in HIV-1 viral load and a 4-fold rebound as the escape mutation emerged. Overall, our data suggest the development of a very limited number of neutralizing antibody specificities during the early stages of HIV-1 subtype C infection, with temporal fluctuations in specificities as escape occurs. While the mechanism of neutralization escape appears to vary between individuals, the involvement of limited regions suggests there might be common vulnerabilities in the HIV-1 subtype C transmitted envelope.\n",
      "Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) expressing HIV-1 genes are promising vaccine candidates. Toward the goal of conducting clinical trials with one or a cocktail of recombinant viruses, four rMVAs expressing env and gag-pol genes from primary HIV-1 isolates representing predominant subtypes from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Thailand (A, C, D, and CRF01_AE, respectively) were constructed. Efficient expression, processing, and function of Env and Gag were demonstrated. All inserted genes were shown to be genetically stable after repeated passage in cell culture. Strong HIV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses were elicited in mice immunized with each individual vaccine candidate. The MVA/CMDR vaccine candidate expressing CRF01_AE genes has elicited HIV-specific T-cell responses in two independent Phase I clinical trials. Further testing of the other rMVA is warranted.\n",
      "An enzyme immunoassay to detect recent HIV-1 infection (EIA-RI) of less than 6 months is routinely performed on diagnoses reported to the National HIV case surveillance in France. We assessed the performance of the EIA-RI infection on this country population scale by measuring its agreement with other indicators of time since infection that were obtained through clinical, biological or testing history recorded on the surveillance reporting form.\n",
      "We used data from the National HIV case surveillance from its debut in March 2003 to June 2007. Infection within 6 months was defined as a negative test reported within 6 months prior to diagnosis. We further ascertained this definition by adding information about of a symptomatic primary infection or biological evidence of recent seroconversion. Infection established for more than 6 months was defined when a positive test had occurred more than 6 months prior to the reported diagnosis.\n",
      "Time since infection could be ascertained in 6782 of 15, 331 (44.2%) HIV diagnoses. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 73.8 and 83.7%, respectively. Among the 1940 cases originating from Sub-Saharan Africa, sensitivity and specificity were 54.1 and 90.8%, respectively.\n",
      "Assessment of the performance of the EIA-RI on a large and heterogeneous population revealed two major findings--significant discrepancies in timing from infection near the 180-day cutoff, and a performance that depends on the geographic origin of patients. This has implications for estimating the assay window period and in the perspective of incidence estimation from HIV case surveillance.\n",
      "The objective of the study was to investigate the HIV-mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate in Israel. This was a retrospective study of HIV-infected pregnant women, mainly immigrants from Ethiopia, in six Israeli AIDS centres, in 2000-2005. Medical records of mothers and newborns were evaluated for HIV status, treatment and MTCT rates. Three hundred pregnancies of 241 HIV-infected women, resulting in 304 live births, were studied. In 86/241(36%) women, HIV diagnosis was made during the current pregnancy or shortly after labour. Thirty others were diagnosed during previous pregnancies. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was prescribed in 76% of pregnancies. The mean viral load before labour was 23,000 +/- 100,000 copies/mL with a mean CD4 of 406 +/- 223 (range 4-1277) cells/mm(3). Caesarian sections were preformed in 175/300 pregnancies (103/175 with viral load <1000 copies/mL). During labour, azidothymidine (AZT) was given to 80% and nevirapine to 8% of the women. Eighty-eight percent of the neonates received AZT for six weeks. The overall HIV-MTCT rate was 3.6%. MTCT correlated significantly with delayed HIV diagnosis, low CD4, lack of HAART during pregnancy and lack of perinatal treatment. HIV treatment of mothers and their newborns throughout pregnancy, labour and perinatal period are crucial for effective prevention of MTCT, emphasizing the need for early HIV screening, diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "Interleukin (IL)-10 directly inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, but it may also promote viral persistence by inactivation of effector immune mechanisms. Here, we show in an African cohort that individuals with genotypes associated with high IL-10 production at 2 promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (-1082 and -592) were less likely to become HIV-1 infected but had significantly higher median plasma viral loads during the acute phase (<or=3 months after infection). However, as the infection progressed, the association between genotype and median viral load was reversed. Thus, IL-10 may influence HIV-1 susceptibility and pathogenesis, but effects on the latter may differ according to the infection phase.\n",
      "Estimation of HIV incidence rates is important for timing interventions, planning prevention studies, and monitoring the epidemic. This requires accurate estimation of the \"recency period\" (also known as the \"window period\") between seroconversion and achievement of specific detectable levels of anti-HIV antibody titers, such as the standardized optical density (SOD) in the early phase of HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "To obtain a better understanding of interpatient variation of the recency period, prospective measurements of antiviral antibody titers in the early phase of HIV-1 subtype C infection were quantified by Vironostika-LS. Time of seroconversion was estimated by Fiebig staging.\n",
      "The profiles of SOD values during the first year of infection commonly showed slow initial increase followed by a more rapid increase, although in some patients, SOD values increased rapidly soon after seroconversion. Using an SOD cutoff of 1.0, the average duration of the recency period in subtype C infection in the local epidemic in Botswana was estimated to be 151 days (95% confidence interval: 130 to 172 days) post seroconversion. The recency period was significantly associated (P = 0.007) with the level of viral replication during the first 2-3 months post seroconversion. Reduction of SOD values after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was a dominant pattern in antiretroviral drug (ARV)-treated subjects.\n",
      "Our data suggest that HIV incidence estimation based on sensitive/less sensitive enzyme immunoassay cross-sectional testing could be potentially improved by incorporation of viral load levels at the time of detection of a recent infection.\n",
      "Mycobacterium bovis BCG is considered an attractive live bacterial vaccine vector. In this study, we investigated the immune response of baboons to a primary vaccination with recombinant BCG (rBCG) constructs expressing the gag gene from a South African HIV-1 subtype C isolate, and a boost with HIV-1 subtype C Pr55(gag) virus-like particles (Gag VLPs). Using an interferon enzyme-linked immunospot assay, we show that although these rBCG induced only a weak or an undetectable HIV-1 Gag-specific response on their own, they efficiently primed for a Gag VLP boost, which strengthened and broadened the immune responses. These responses were predominantly CD8+ T cell-mediated and recognised similar epitopes as those targeted by humans with early HIV-1 subtype C infection. In addition, a Gag-specific humoral response was elicited. These data support the development of HIV-1 vaccines based on rBCG and Pr55(gag) VLPs.\n",
      "Undetectable HIV infection in blood banks poses a serious threat to public health. Thus, donations from high school students are preferred over adult samples in Kenyan blood banks, due to lower HIV infection prevalence within this population, as detected by conventional serology testing. However, the number of recently infected individuals remains difficult to identify, as HIV-induced immunological window periods can span months. This study focuses on the potential contribution of a novel mode of diagnostic testing in revealing early, seronegative HIV carriers.\n",
      "Stimmunology, an in vitro lymphocyte stimulation technique, was used to detect early HIV infection among random samples of adult and adolescent blood donors. The Stimmunology protocol unveiled a significant number of early, pre-seroconversion HIV carriers both among adult and teenage Kenyan populations, undetected by typical serological diagnostic kits. Both populations demonstrated a significant increase in HIV-specific antibody formation following activation using the Stimmunology assay. The younger population exhibited a higher proportion of early HIV infection (0.45) than the adult (0.27) population.\n",
      "While blood samples of young donors are preferred over adult donations, these data demonstrate a worrisome ratio of early, seronegative HIV carriers within this population. This simple, cost-effective, and reliable HIV-boosting antibody assay can be used in a resource-poor setting to increase blood supply safety and quality. Incorporation of Stimmunology into basic blood bank testing and into diagnostic protocols can also decrease undesirable disease transmission.\n",
      "We aimed to investigate the contribution of disease stage and weight for age to the variability in psychomotor outcome observed among children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study involved 48 Kenyan children (20 females, 28 males) aged 6 to 35 months (mean 19.9mo SD 8.9) exposed prenatally to HIV. Two subgroups of HIV-exposed children were seen: those who were HIV-infected and those who were uninfected. The reference population was composed of 319 children (159 females, 160 males) aged 6-35 months, (mean age = 19 months, SD=8.43) randomly selected from the community. Disease stage varied from stage 1 to stage 3, reflecting progression from primary HIV infection to advanced HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A locally developed and validated measure, the Kilifi Developmental Inventory, was used to assess psychomotor development.\n",
      "Using age-corrected psychomotor scores, a significant main effect of HIV status was observed (F((2,38.01))=7.89, p<0.001). Children in the HIV-infected group had lower mean psychomotor scores than the HIV-exposed children and the reference group. In the HIV-infected group, disease stage was a negative predictor and weight for age a positive predictor of psychomotor outcome.\n",
      "Weight for age and disease stage provide viable, easily measurable benchmarks to specify when frequent developmental monitoring and psychomotor rehabilitation are required. Nutritional intervention and other measures aimed at slowing disease progression may delay the onset and severity of psychomotor impairment in the paediatric HIV population in Africa.\n",
      "The CBD1 peptide (SLEQIWNNMTWMQWDK), corresponding to the consensus caveolin-1 binding domain in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 (CBD1), elicits the production of antibodies that inhibit infection of primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes by various primary HIV-1 isolates. Here we show that HIV-neutralizing antibodies against CBD1 react with multiple conformational epitopes that overlap the highly conserved caveolin-1 binding motif (CBM) with the N-terminal conserved isoleucine residue. The CBM-based peptides IWNNMTWMQW and IWNNMTW when fused to a T helper epitope are immunogenic by inducing high titer CBM-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 infection in primary T lymphocyte cultures. Interestingly, neutralizing immune sera raised against a given peptide do not cross-react with related CBM-derived peptides, thus suggesting the existence of distinct neutralizing epitopes that probably reflect the dynamic conformational features of CBD1. In accord with this, the mixture of neutralizing immune sera raised against several CBM-derived peptides exerts a synergistic neutralizing activity against HIV-1 infection. Finally, the existence of several distinct overlapping epitopes in CBD1 is confirmed by murine monoclonal antibodies that we generated against the CBM-derived chimeric peptides. Our results indicate that CBD1- and CBM-based peptides mimic distinct dynamic conformations of CBD1, and thus such peptides could provide specific immunogens for an efficient vaccine preparation against HIV/AIDS infection.\n",

      "Pregnant women were retested between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation, provided that they had been tested HIV negative at least 3 months prior.\n",
      "Among the 2377 HIV-negative women retested, 1099 (46.2%) and 1278 (53.4%) were tested at urban and rural health facilities, respectively. Seventy-two women (3%) were HIV-positive (679 woman years of exposure) yielding a HIV incidence rate of 10.7/100 woman years [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.2-13.1]. HIV incidence in pregnancy was higher but not statistically significant at the urban facilities (12.4/100 woman years versus 9.1/100 woman years) and at least two-fold higher among the 25-29 and 30-34-year age groups (3.8 and 4.5%, respectively) as compared with the less than 20-year age group (1.9%). Single women were at 2.5 times higher risk of seroconverting during pregnancy (P = 0.017).\n",
      "HIV incidence during pregnancy is four times higher than in the nonpregnant population reported in a recent survey. Public health programs need to continue to reinforce prevention strategies and HIV retesting during pregnancy. The latter also offers an additional opportunity to prevent mother-to-child transmission and further horizontal transmission. Further research is required to understand the cause of primary HIV infection in pregnancy.\n",

To estimate the effect of ART on TB incidence while accounting for time-dependent confounders affected by exposure, a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model was used.\n",
      "364 children contributed 596.0 person-years of follow-up. At baseline, the median age was 6.9 years; 163 (44.8%) were in HIV clinical stage 3 or 4. During follow-up, 242 (66.5%) children initiated ART and 81 (22.3%) developed TB. At TB diagnosis, 41 (50.6%) were receiving ART. The TB incidence rate in those receiving ART was 10.2 per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.4-13.9] compared with 20.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 14.6-27.8) in those receiving only primary HIV care. TB incidence decreased with time on ART, from 18.9 per 100 person-years in the first 6 months to 5.3 per 100 person-years after 12 months of ART. The model-estimated TB hazard ratio for ART was 0.51 (95% CI 0.27-0.94).\n",

      "Breast-feeding infants born to HIV-1-seropositive women were assessed for HLA-selected HIV-1 peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte interferon (IFN)-gamma responses by means of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Responses were deemed to be positive when they reached > or = 50 HIV-1-specific sfu/1 x 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and were at least twice those of negative controls.\n",
      "A total of 807 ELISpot assays were performed for 217 infants who remained uninfected with HIV-1 at approximately 12 months of age; 101 infants (47%) had at least 1 positive ELISpot result (median, 78-170 sfu/1 x 10(6) PBMCs). The prevalence and magnitude of responses increased with age (P = .01 and P = .007, respectively); the median log(10) value for HIV-1-specific IFN-gamma responses increased by 1.0 sfu/1 x 10(6) PBMCs/month (P < .001) between 1 and 12 months of age. Of 141 HIV-1-uninfected infants with 1-month ELISpot results, 10 (7%) acquired HIV-1 infection (0/16 with positive vs. 10/125 [8%] with negative ELISpot results; P = .6). Higher values for log(10) HIV-1-specific spot-forming units at 1 month of age were associated with a decreased risk of HIV-1 infection, adjusted for maternal HIV-1 RNA level (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.09 [95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.72]).\n",

Samples identified as HBsAg-negative/DNA-positive were confirmed by combining real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, nested amplification, anti-HBc and anti-HBs. Amplified basic core promoter/precore, pre-S/S, and whole genome were sequenced, analyzed, and compared to 73 HBsAg+ strains. Genotype was determined by phylogenetic analysis. From 109 samples examined, 54 were classified as OBI, 14 as WP, 20 as false-positive, five as other classification, and 16 as undetermined due to lack of serological or follow-up data. OBI donors were predominantly males (67%), median age 31 years, black (54%), with normal alanine aminotransferase levels. Viral load ranged between unquantifiable and 518 IU/mL (median 5 IU/mL). Genotype A1 was more frequent (23 strains) than genotype D (seven strains). Genotype A1 strains were little mutated. In the major hydrophilic region, 56.5% strains were wild type or with few amino acid substitutions. Most important, all 13 full genome sequences presented 1 to 7 mutations known to or assumed to negatively impact viral replication. In particular, 6/13 sequences had a stop codon in the HBx gene translated into deletion of 117 or 19-25 C-terminus amino acids not found in 15 HBeAg+ HBsAg+ strains. One WP sequence with an HBx stop codon suggested infectivity.\n",
      "Genotype A1 OBIs are different from genotype A2 and D OBIs in that there is little evidence of immune pressure as a major factor involved in OBI genesis. Limited replication appears mostly related to genetic viral defects.\n",
      "Human TRIM5alpha (TRIM5alphahu), a member of the tripartite motif protein family, displays some anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity in vitro, although it is substantially less potent than its rhesus monkey counterpart (TRIM5alpharh). The effects of levels of TRIM5alphahu on prevention or control of HIV-1 infection in vivo are unknown.\n",
      "We used a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to measure levels of TRIM5alphahu expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a cohort of individuals at high risk for HIV-1 infection in Durban, South Africa. Samples were available from 38 infected subjects (with all these samples obtained within 1 year of infection) and from 57 uninfected persons. Matched preinfection and postinfection samples were available from 13 individuals.\n",
      "TRIM5alphahu messenger RNA levels were lower in the PBMCs of HIV-1-infected subjects than in those of uninfected subjects (P <.001). Seroconverters had lower preinfection levels of TRIM5alphahu than did nonseroconverters (P<.001). TRIM5alphahu levels did not change significantly after infection. There was no correlation between TRIM5alphahu levels and viral loads or CD4(+) T cell counts.\n",
      "High expression of TRIM5alphahu is associated with reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, infection is not associated with disregulation of TRIM5alphahu. TRIM5alphahu expression levels do not contribute to the control of primary HIV-1 viremia.\n",
      "Our objectives were to assess clinical signs and diagnoses associated with primary HIV-1 infection among infants.\n",
      "We analyzed data from a clinical trial (HIV Prevention Trials Network Protocol 024) in sub-Saharan Africa. Study visits were conducted at birth, at 4-6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The study population comprised live born, singleton, first-born infants of HIV-1-infected women with negative HIV-1 RNA assays who were still breastfeeding at 4-6 weeks.\n",
      "Of 1317 HIV-1-exposed infants, 84 became HIV-1 infected after 4-6 weeks and 1233 remained uninfected. There were 102 primary and 5650 nonprimary infection visits. The most common signs were cough and diarrhea, and the most common diagnoses were malaria and pneumonia. Primary infection was associated with significantly increased odds of diarrhea [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4], pneumonia (OR = 3.5), otitis media (OR = 3.1), and oral thrush (OR = 2.9). For the clinical signs and diagnoses evaluated, sensitivity was low (1%-16.7%) and specificity was high (88.2%-99%). Positive predictive values ranged from 0.1%-1.4%. Negative predictive values ranged from 28.0%-51.1%.\n",
      "Certain clinical signs and diagnoses, although more common during primary HIV-1 infection, had low sensitivity and high specificity. Efforts to expand access to laboratory assays for the diagnosis of primary HIV-1 infection among infants of HIV-1-infected women should be emphasized.\n",
      "Tuberculosis is prevalent worldwide. Even in developed countries there is a resurgence of tuberculosis mainly due to increasing HIV infection. Tuberculous ileal perforation is uncommon. It is, however, a potentially fatal complication of intestinal tuberculosis especially in HIV/AIDS patient.\n",
      "To highlight tuberculous ileal perforation as an underestimated complication of intestinal tuberculosis in an HIV patient presenting with acute abdomen.\n",
      "A 42-year-old HIV positive long distance truck driver with tuberculous ileal perforation is presented and related literatures reviewed.\n",
      "Intestinal perforation due to abdominal tuberculosis is an aetiological factor in acute HIV abdomen. High index of suspicion remains the key to diagnosis.\n",
      "It has been predicted that CD4 C868T, a novel CD4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that has been found to be highly prevalent among Africans, changes the tertiary structure of CD4, which may alter susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n",
      "Participants were from a Kenyan cohort and included 87 uninfected and 277 HIV-1-infected individuals. DNA sequencing was used to determine CD4 genotype. A2.01 cells expressing similar levels of either wild-type CD4 or CD4-Trp240 as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors were infected with HIV-1(IIIB) or a Kenyan primary HIV-1 isolate. HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the outcome of infection.\n",
      "CD4 C868T was found to be significantly more prevalent among HIV-1-infected participants than among HIV-1-uninfected participants (P = .002), and C868T was associated with an increased incidence of HIV-1 infection as well (P = .005, log-rank test; P = .009, Wilcoxon test), with an odds ratio of 2.49 (P = .009). Both in vitro and ex vivo models demonstrated a significant association between CD4 C868T and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (P < .001 and P = .003, respectively).\n",
      "Overall, the present study found a strong correlation between CD4 C868T and increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Given the high prevalence of both HIV infection and CD4 C868T in African populations, the effect of this SNP on the epidemic in Africa could be dramatic.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C is the dominant subtype globally, due largely to the incidence of subtype C infections in sub-Saharan Africa and east Asia. We compared the relative replicative fitness (ex vivo) of the major (M) group of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, and CRF01_AE and group O isolates. To estimate pathogenic fitness, pairwise competitions were performed between CCR5-tropic (R5) or CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). A general fitness order was observed among 33 HIV-1 isolates; subtype B and D HIV-1 isolates were slightly more fit than the subtype A and dramatically more fit than the 12 subtype C isolates. All group M isolates were more fit (ex vivo) than the group O isolates. To estimate ex vivo transmission fitness, a subset of primary HIV-1 isolates were examined in primary human explants from penile, cervical, and rectal tissues. Only R5 isolates and no X4 HIV-1 isolates could replicate in these tissues, whereas the spread to PM1 cells was dependent on active replication and passive virus transfer. In tissue competition experiments, subtype C isolates could compete with and, in some cases, even win over subtype A and D isolates. However, when the migratory cells from infected tissues were mixed with a susceptible cell line, the subtype C isolates were outcompeted by other subtypes, as observed in experiments with PBMC. These findings suggest that subtype C HIV-1 isolates might have equal transmission fitness but reduced pathogenic fitness relative to other group M HIV-1 isolates.\n",
      "Most knowledge of primary HIV-1 infection is based on subtype B studies, whereas the evolution of viral parameters in the early phase of HIV-1 subtype C infection is not well characterized.\n",
      "The kinetics of viral RNA, proviral DNA, CD4+ T-cell count, and subsets of CD4+ T cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 were characterized in 8 acute and 62 recent subtype C infections over the first year postseroconversion.\n",
      "The viral RNA peak was 6.25 +/- 0.92 log10 copies per milliliter. After seroconversion, heterogeneity among acute cases was evident by patterns of change in viral load and CD4+ T-cell count over time. The patterns were supported by the rate of viral RNA decline from peak (P = 0.022), viral RNA means (P = 0.005), CD4 levels (P < 0.001), and CD4 decline to 350 (P = 0.011) or 200 (P = 0.046). Proviral DNA had no apparent peak and its mean was 2.59 +/- 0.69 log10 per 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cell. In recent infections, viral RNA set point was 4.00 +/- 0.97 log10 and viral RNA correlated inversely with CD4+ T cells (P < 0.001) and directly with proviral DNA (P < 0.001).\n",
      "Distinct patterns of viral RNA evolution may exist shortly after seroconversion in HIV-1 subtype C infection. The study provides better understanding of the early phase of subtype C infection.\n",
      "The window period between infection and seroconversion varies based on viral genetics, dose and route of transmission, host genetics, and environmental factors. The in vitro Stimmunology blood pretreatment assay was utilized to promote the synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies in efforts to define the window period between infection and seroconversion. Ethiopians seeking immigration to Israel while in refugee camps provided a unique cohort to perform a comparative analysis of the window period between HIV-1 infection and diagnosis utilizing conventional Ab-ELISA and our laboratory established an in vitro Stimmunolog assay. This population was considered unique due to its exposure to an environment with a high seroprevalence rate for a defined period of time. Unlinked blood samples were tested and validated before and after Stimmunology. Diagnostic screening was conducted in Israel. A total of 285 and 537 random samples were tested from the 1992 and 1998 immigrant population, respectively. Analysis of HIV prevalence, incidence, and window period length among the immigrants was measured by comparing results obtained on samples prior to and following analysis by Stimmunology as compared with standard ELISA-based assay. This novel assay that promotes the in vitro stimulation of antibody synthesis led to the diagnosis of 2.7% and 0.36% of the 1992 and 1998 immigrant groups, respectively, as HIV infected individuals during the window period. Using mathematical modeling, the length of the window period in the surveyed population was estimated to range from 2 to 5 months. Stimmunology-aided detection of early seronegative HIV-infected individuals provided a reliable and consistent mode of identifying infection in seronegative HIV-1-infected individuals. Applying mathematical modeling to the data obtained enabled us to define the window period length, which was found to extend beyond previous estimates. These results suggest a need for the reevaluation of the techniques that are employed to assess the true incidence and prevalence of HIV-1 infection, especially in populations within sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Although granulomas may be an essential host response against persistent antigens, they are also associated with immunopathology. We investigated whether HIV co-infection affects histopathological appearance and cytokine profiles of pleural granulomas in patients with active pleural tuberculosis (TB). Granulomas were investigated in pleural biopsies from HIV positive and negative TB pleuritis patients. Granulomas were characterised as necrotic or non-necrotic, graded histologically and investigated for the mRNA expression of IL-12, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-4 by in situ hybridisation. In all TB patients a mixed Th1/Th2 profile was noted. Necrotic granulomas were more evident in HIV positive patients with a clear association between TNF-alpha and necrosis. This study demonstrates immune dysregulation which may include TNF-alpha-mediated immunopathology at the site of disease in HIV infected pleural TB patients.\n",
      "To review biomedical determinants of women's vulnerability to infection with HIV and interventions to counter this, within the southern African context.\n",
      "Apart from number of exposures, if any, several factors influence the efficiency of HIV transmission during sex. Acute HIV infection, with extraordinarily high semen viral load, in conjunction with concurrent partnerships maximizes this efficiency. Delaying sexual debut and avoiding HIV exposure among biologically and socially vulnerable youth is critical. Reducing unintended pregnancies keeps girls in school and prevents vertical (also possibly horizontal) transmission. Female condoms, especially newer versions, are an under-exploited prevention technology. Control of sexually transmitted infections (STI), which facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission, remains important, especially among the most at-risk populations. Pathogens, such as herpes simplex virus type 2, which contribute most to HIV transmission in southern Africa must be targeted, although the importance of bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis is under-recognized. Also, heavy episodic alcohol use affects sexual decision-making and condom skills. Moreover, prevailing social contexts, partly a consequence of poor leadership, constrain the behavioural 'choices' available for girls and women.\n",
      "Priority health sector interventions for preventing HIV are: male and female condom programming; prevention and control of STI; outreach to most vulnerable populations; HIV testing in all patient-provider encounters; male circumcision; and the integration of HIV prevention within sexual and reproductive health services. Future interventions during acute HIV infection and microbicides will reduce women's biological vulnerability. Far-reaching measures, such as sexual equity and alcohol control, create conditions necessary for achieving sustained prevention results. These are, however, contingent on stronger, more informed cultural and political leadership.\n",
      "In countries with a high seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV infection contributes significantly to infant mortality. We investigated antiretroviral-treatment strategies in the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) trial.\n",
      "HIV-infected infants 6 to 12 weeks of age with a CD4 lymphocyte percentage (the CD4 percentage) of 25% or more were randomly assigned to receive antiretroviral therapy (lopinavir-ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine) when the CD4 percentage decreased to less than 20% (or 25% if the child was younger than 1 year) or clinical criteria were met (the deferred antiretroviral-therapy group) or to immediate initiation of limited antiretroviral therapy until 1 year of age or 2 years of age (the early antiretroviral-therapy groups). We report the early outcomes for infants who received deferred antiretroviral therapy as compared with early antiretroviral therapy.\n",
      "At a median age of 7.4 weeks (interquartile range, 6.6 to 8.9) and a CD4 percentage of 35.2% (interquartile range, 29.1 to 41.2), 125 infants were randomly assigned to receive deferred therapy, and 252 infants were randomly assigned to receive early therapy. After a median follow-up of 40 weeks (interquartile range, 24 to 58), antiretroviral therapy was initiated in 66% of infants in the deferred-therapy group. Twenty infants in the deferred-therapy group (16%) died versus 10 infants in the early-therapy groups (4%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 0.51; P<0.001). In 32 infants in the deferred-therapy group (26%) versus 16 infants in the early-therapy groups (6%), disease progressed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage C or severe stage B (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.41; P<0.001). Stavudine was substituted for zidovudine in four infants in the early-therapy groups because of neutropenia in three infants and anemia in one infant; no drugs were permanently discontinued. After a review by the data and safety monitoring board, the deferred-therapy group was modified, and infants in this group were all reassessed for initiation of antiretroviral therapy.\n",
      "Early HIV diagnosis and early antiretroviral therapy reduced early infant mortality by 76% and HIV progression by 75%. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00102960.)\n",
      "A retrospective cohort study of mortality rates and potential predictors of death was conducted in public-sector patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) between October 2005 and September 2007 in a rural, under-resourced region of South Africa. The aims were to determine the relative contribution of death to cohort exit and the causes and predictors of mortality among HAART initiators. A community outreach programme traced non-attenders. Patients categorised as dying at home underwent a verbal autopsy (by interviewing family members) and case-file review, and those dying in hospital a case-file review, to determine the probable cause of death. At 24 months 1131 (83.6%) patients were retained on treatment in the programme, 124 (9.2%) had died, 63 (4.7%) had transferred out, and 35 (2.6%) were lost to follow-up. The most common causes of death were tuberculosis (44.3%) and diarrhoeal diseases (24.5%). Death was the major reason for cohort exit. As experience is gained with rural HAART programmes mortality rates may decrease. These results draw attention to the need for early HIV diagnosis, increased access to HAART services with earlier treatment initiation, and routine screening and aggressive management of opportunistic infections, particularly tuberculosis.\n",
      "To date, an estimated 10% of children eligible for antiretroviral treatment (ART) receive it, and the frequency of retention in programs is unknown. We evaluated the 2-year risks of death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) of children after ART initiation in a multicenter study in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Pooled analysis of routine individual data from 16 participating clinics produced overall Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probabilities of death or LTFU after ART initiation. Risk factors analysis used Weibull regression, accounting for between-cohort heterogeneity.\n",
      "The median age of 2405 children at ART initiation was 4.9 years (12%, younger than 12 months), 52% were male, 70% had severe immunodeficiency, and 59% started ART with a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The 2-year risk of death after ART initiation was 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.9 to 8.1), independently associated with baseline severe anemia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 4.10 [CI: 2.36 to 7.13]), immunodeficiency (adjusted aHR: 2.95 [CI: 1.49 to 5.82]), and severe clinical status (adjusted aHR: 3.64 [CI: 1.95 to 6.81]); the 2-year risk of LTFU was 10.3% (CI: 8.9 to 11.9), higher in children with severe clinical status.\n",
      "Once on treatment, the 2-year risk of death is low but the LTFU risk is substantial. ART is still mainly initiated at advanced disease stage in African children, reinforcing the need for early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of ART, and procedures to increase program retention.\n",
      "To explore the type and prevalence of oral mucosal lesions among adults with primary HIV infection (PHI) compared with HIV-negative adults at high risk for HIV disease, and in relation to HIV viral load.\n",
      "We conducted standardized oral examinations to identify specific oral mucosal lesions among adults with PHI, both pre-seroconversion and post- seroconversion-recently infected, compared with HIV-negative adults. We compared the group with oral lesions to those without oral lesions with respect to HIV-RNA load and CD4 + T-cell count.\n",
      "Among 115 adults (predominantly men), pseudomembranous candidiasis was the most common oral lesion among those with PHI, and was found in 4% of the 23 participants in pre-seroconversion and in 9% of 69 participants with post-seroconversion recent infection, compared with none found among 23 HIV negatives. Among those with PHI, the median viral load was higher and the median CD4 + T-cell count lower among the 15 participants with an oral lesion of any type than among the 77 participants without oral lesions (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively).\n",
      "This finding suggests that individuals with PHI who have oral lesions may be more likely to transmit HIV because of their higher viral load.\n",
      "To better understand the limits of antigenic reactivity and epitope accessibility of the V3 domain of primary HIV-1 isolates, we evaluated three human anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and selected guinea pig vaccine sera for neutralization against reference panels of subtype B and C pseudoviruses derived from early stage infections. The mAbs and vaccine sera potently neutralized several prototype viruses, but displayed substantially less neutralization of most reference strains. In the presence of soluble CD4 (sCD4), the breadth of V3-mediated neutralization was increased; up to 80% and 77% of the subtype B and C viruses respectively were sensitive to V3-mediated neutralization. Unlike sCD4, the reaction of CD4-binding site mAbs b12 and F105 with native virus did not lead to full exposure of the V3 domain. These findings confirm that V3 antibodies recognize most primary viral strains, but that the epitope often has limited accessibility in the context of native envelope spike.\n",
      "Failure to determine the HIV status of all pregnant women impedes progress in preventing and treating paediatric HIV because vertically exposed infants are not identified for prophylaxis, early HIV diagnosis and care.\n",
      "To assess the performance of rapid HIV tests in comparison to a laboratory-based HIV ELISA test for determining HIV-exposure and excluding HIV infection during infancy.\n",
      "Seven rapid HIV tests were evaluated on 2266 stored samples from 116 HIV-exposed infants of known HIV status at four ages during infancy. The HIV ELISA for each sample was the standard against which rapid results were assessed to establish HIV-exposure.\n",
      "Rapid tests did not perform uniformly during infancy. For detecting HIV-exposure the sensitivity of most rapid tests to 3 months of age approached that of an HIV ELISA however only Determine maintained this sensitivity (99.7%) throughout infancy. For excluding HIV infection (i.e. for correctly identifying HIV-uninfected infants) the specificity of all rapid tests except Determine exceeded that of the HIV ELISA from 7 months of age.\n",
      "The use of rapid tests in infancy could improve identification and care of HIV-exposed infants. Further evaluation under field conditions is required before rapid tests can be incorporated into evidence-based diagnostic algorithms.\n",
      "The host immune response against mucosally acquired pathogens may be influenced by the mucosal immune milieu during acquisition. As Neisseria gonorrhoeae can impair dendritic cell and T-cell immune function, we hypothesized that coinfection during HIV acquisition would impair subsequent systemic T-cell responses.\n",
      "Monthly screening for sexually transmitted infections was performed in high risk, HIV seronegative Kenyan female sex workers as part of an HIV prevention trial. Early HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses and subsequent HIV viral load set point were assayed in participants acquiring HIV, and were correlated with the presence of prior genital infections during HIV acquisition.\n",
      "Thirty-five participants acquired HIV during follow-up, and 16 out of 35 (46%) had a classical sexually transmitted infection at the time of acquisition. N. gonorrhoeae coinfection was present during HIV acquisition in 6 out of 35 (17%), and was associated with an increased breadth and magnitude of systemic HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses, using both interferon-gamma gamma and MIP-1 beta as an output. No other genital infections were associated with differences in HIV-specific CD8 T-cell response, and neither N. gonorrhoeae nor other genital infections were associated with differences in HIV plasma viral load at set point.\n",
      "Unexpectedly, genital N. gonorrhoeae infection during heterosexual HIV acquisition was associated with substantially enhanced HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses, although not with differences in HIV viral load set point. This may have implications for the development of mucosal HIV vaccines and adjuvants.\n",
      "Morbidity and mortality patterns among pregnant women and their infants (before antiretroviral therapy was widely available) determines HIV-1 diagnostic, monitoring, and care interventions.\n",
      "Data from mothers and their infants enrolled in a trial of antibiotics to reduce mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1 at 4 sub-Saharan African sites were analyzed. Women were enrolled during pregnancy and follow-up continued until the infants reached 12 months of age. We describe maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in a cohort of HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected mothers. Maternal and infant factors associated with mortality risk in the infants were assessed using Cox proportional hazard modeling.\n",
      "Among 2292 HIV-1-infected mothers, 166 (7.2%) had a serious adverse event (SAE) and 42 (1.8%) died, whereas no deaths occurred among the 331 HIV-1 uninfected mothers. Four hundred twenty-four (17.8%) of 2383 infants had an SAE and 349 (16.4%) died before the end of follow-up. Infants with early HIV-1 infection (birth to 4-6 weeks) had the highest mortality. Among infants born to HIV-1-infected women, maternal morbidity and mortality (P = 0.0001), baseline CD4 count (P = 0.0002), and baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration (P < 0.0001) were significant predictors of infant mortality in multivariate analyses.\n",
      "The high mortality among infants with early HIV-1 infection supports access to HIV-1 diagnostics and appropriate early treatment for all infants of HIV-1-infected mothers. The significant association between stage of maternal HIV-1 infection and infant mortality supports routine CD4 counts at the time of prenatal HIV-1 testing.\n",
      "Inflammatory responses at mucosal surfaces after human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission may influence disease outcome. We evaluated levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 in genital tract and plasma specimens from 44 women with acute HIV infection and 29 HIV-negative control women (13 of whom were women in the acute HIV infection cohort who had preinfection samples available for analysis). Women with acute HIV infection had significantly elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 in genital tract specimens and elevated levels of IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-10 in plasma specimens, compared with HIV-negative control women. Levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in cervicovaginal specimens from women with acute HIV infection showed a significant inverse correlation with systemic CD4(+) cell counts, suggesting that mucosal inflammation is associated with low CD4(+) cell counts during acute HIV infection.\n",
      "Methods for identification of primary HIV infections seem increasingly important to understand pathogenesis, and to prevent transmission, which is particularly efficient during acute infection. Most current algorithms for HIV testing are based on detection of HIV antibodies and are unable to identify early infections before seroconversion. The efficiency of prospective cohorts, which is a standard approach for identifying primary HIV-1 infection, depends on a variety of epidemiological and cultural factors including HIV incidence and stigma and, not surprisingly, varies significantly in different geographical areas. We report a voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)-based approach to identifying primary HIV-1C infection that was developed as part of a primary HIV-1 subtype C infection study in Botswana. The referral strategy was based on: (1) collaboration with VCT centers at city clinics operated by the Ministry of Health; (2) partnering with the busiest non-government VCT center; (3) educating healthcare workers and the community about primary HIV infection; and (4) pairing with diverse VCT providers, including NGOs and private-sector organizations. Acute HIV-1 infections were defined by a negative HIV-1 serology combined with a positive HIV-1 RT-PCR test. Recent HIV-1 infections were identified by detuned EIA testing according to the classic STARTH algorithm. The VCT-based referral strategy resulted in the successful identification of 57 cases of acute and early HIV infection. A referral strategy of expanded VCT with viral RNA (Ribonucleic acid) testing to a national program in Botswana may be a promising approach for identification of primary HIV infections on a countrywide level. The program should offer VCT with viral RNA testing to the general public, facilitate proper counseling and risk reduction, and allow initiation of early HAART, and may reduce new viral transmissions.\n",
      "Sexual transmission of HIV most closely reflects the concentration of HIV in the genital tract; HIV in the genital tract of subjects with acute HIV and some \"classical\" STDS is 8-10 times greater than in control subjects. It seems likely that these latter subjects lead to spread of HIV. Accordingly, the state of North Carolina committed to HIV testing that detects subjects with acute, recent, and established infection. We tested 109,500 samples over 9 months. We found 563 people with undiagnosed HIV infection. The majority of subjects were in STD clinics. This included 23 subjects with (pre-seroconversion) acute HIV infection (HIV RNA positive, antibody negative). The median blood HIV was 209,000 copies/ml, more than 10 times higher than in subjects with established HIV infection. Recognizing the increased number of subjects with unrecognized acute HIV infection in STD clinics, we conducted similar studies in STD Clinics in Malawi and South Africa. Between 1 and 2% of subjects had undetected acute HIV infection. The median viral burden in blood of subjects in Malawi was greater than 1,000,000 copies/ml. STDS and HIV are often co-transmitted, and STDS set the stage for subsequent HIV transmission. Prevention of sexual transmission of HIV likely requires maximal suppression of genital tract HIV viral burden, either through treatment of STDS or use of antiretroviral agents.\n",
      "To assess the 18-month field effectiveness on severe events of a pediatric package combining early HIV-diagnosis and targeted cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children from age six-week before the antiretroviral era, in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.\n",
      "Data from two consecutive prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission programs were compared: the ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame-Plus cohort (2001-2005) and the pooled data of the ANRS 049a Ditrame randomized trial and its following open-labeled cohort (1995-2000), used as a reference group. HIV-infected pregnant women > or = 32-36 weeks of gestation were offered a short-course peri-partum antiretroviral prophylaxis (ZDV in Ditrame, and ZDV +/- 3TC+single-dose (sd) NVP in Ditrame-Plus). Neonatal prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame-Plus only: 7-day ZDV and sdNVP 48-72 h after birth. A 6-week pediatric HIV-RNA diagnosis was provided on-line in the Ditrame-Plus while it was only oriented on clinical symptoms in Ditrame. Six-week HIV-infected children received a daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in Ditrame-Plus while no prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame. The determinants of severe events (death or hospitalization > 1 day) were assessed in a Cox regression model.\n",
      "Between 1995 and 2003, 98 out of the 1121 live-births were diagnosed as HIV-infected in peri-partum: 45 from Ditrame-Plus and 53 from Ditrame. The 18-month Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of presenting a severe event was 66% in Ditrame-Plus (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 50%-81%) and 77% in Ditrame (95%CI: 65%-89%), Log Rank test: p = 0.47. After adjustment on maternal WHO clinical stage, maternal death, 6-week pediatric viral load, birth-weight, and breastfeeding exposure, the 18-month risk of severe event was lower in Ditrame-Plus than in Ditrame (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 0.55, 95%CI: 0.3-1.1), although the difference was not statistically significant; p = 0.07). Maternal death was the only variable determinant of the occurrence of severe events in children (aHR: 3.73; CI: 2.2-11.2; p = 0.01).\n",
      "Early cotrimoxazole from 6 weeks of age in HIV-infected infants seemed to reduce probability of severe events but the study lacked statistical power to prove this. Even with systematic cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, infant morbidity and mortality remained high pointing towards a need for early pediatric HIV-diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment in Africa.\n",
      "To describe the baseline demographic data, clinical characteristics and HIV-incidence rates of a cohort at high risk for HIV infection in South Africa as well as the challenges experienced in establishing and maintaining the cohort.\n",
      "Between August 2004 and May 2005 a cohort of HIV-uninfected women was established for the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection Study, a natural history study of HIV-1 subtype C infection. Volunteers were identified through peer-outreach. The cohort was followed monthly to determine HIV infection rates and clinical presentation of early HIV infection. Risk reduction counselling and male and female condoms were provided. After screening 775 individuals, a cohort of 245 uninfected high-risk women was established. HIV-prevalence at screening was 59.6% (95% CI: 55.9% to 62.8%) posing a challenge in accruing HIV-uninfected women. The majority of women (78.8%) were self-identified as sex-workers with a median of 2 clients per day. Most women (95%) reported more than one casual sexual partner in the previous 3 months (excluding clients) and 58.8% reported condom use in their last sexual encounter. Based on laboratory testing, 62.0% had a sexually transmitted infection at baseline. During 390 person-years of follow-up, 28 infections occurred yielding seroincidence rate of 7.2 (95% CI: 4.5 to 9.8) per 100 person-years. Despite the high mobility of this sex worker cohort retention rate after 2 years was 86.1%. High co-morbidity created challenges for ancillary care provision, both in terms of human and financial resources.\n",
      "Challenges experienced were high baseline HIV-prevalence, lower than anticipated HIV-incidence and difficulties retaining participants. Despite challenges, we have successfully accrued this cohort of HIV-uninfected women with favourable retention, enabling us to study the natural history of HIV-1 during acute HIV-infection. Our experiences provide lessons for others establishing similar cohorts, which will be key for advancing the vaccine and prevention research agenda in resource-constrained settings.\n",
      "To assess the association between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and fertility history and desire among HIV-positive Ugandan women, we conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-positive Ugandan women aged 18-50 years who attended an HIV clinic at Mbarara University in western Uganda between November 1, 2005 and June 6, 2006. Of 538 women approached, 501 were enrolled. ART use was associated with increased odds of fertility desire (AOR 2.99, 95% CI 1.38-6.28), and decreased odds of pregnancy (AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.95) and live birth (AOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.66). ART was associated with an increase in fertility desire, but was not associated with an increase in fertility. Additional studies will be needed to determine if this greater fertility desire among ART-treated women leads to an increase in fertility as ART use expands.\n",
      "To increase the understanding of mechanisms of HIV control we have genetically and immunologically characterized a full-length HIV-1 isolated from an acute infection in a rare case of undetectable viremia. The subject, a 43-year-old Danish white male (DK1), was diagnosed with acute HIV-1 infection after 1 year in Uganda. Following transient antiretroviral therapy DK1 maintained undetectable viral load for more than 10 years. His Ugandan wife (UG1) developed high viral load. HIV-1 sequences from both individuals were compared by bootscanning for recombination break points. Diversity plots and phylogenic trees were constructed and diversity and evolutionary distances were calculated. Intracellular IFN-gamma in CD8(+)CD3(+) T-lymphocyte reactions was investigated by intracellular flow cytometry (IC-FACS). Virus isolates from both patients were A1D intersubtype recombinants showing 98% sequence homology in shared regions. Four of seven crossover points were identical; however, the env gene from UG1 was subtype D, but A1 in DK1. Both viruses encoded proteins of the expected length and replicated equally well in vitro. DK1 and UG1 shared the HLA-A02 tissue type. HLA-A02-restricted CD8(+) T cell IFN-gamma IC-FACS response in DK1 was detected against only one (Pol(476)) of 23 conserved epitopes. Neutralizing antibodies were induced only to the homologous isolate. These results indicate an A1D intersubtype recombination or transmission of a minor variant. Transient early antiretroviral therapy may have induced full HIV-1 control in this individual mediated by a narrow specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte and neutralizing antibody response and/or other factors yet to be characterized.\n",
      "HIV-neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and HIV-specific cellular immunity have been described in highly exposed, persistently seronegative (HEPS) individuals, but well controlled studies have not been performed. We performed a prospective, nested case-control study to examine the association of genital IgA and systemic cellular immune responses with subsequent HIV acquisition in high-risk Kenyan female sex workers (FSWs).\n",
      "A randomized trial of monthly antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent sexually transmitted disease/HIV infection was performed from 1998 to 2002 in HIV-uninfected Kenyan FSWs. After the completion of trial, FSWs who had acquired HIV (cases) were matched 1: 4 with persistently uninfected controls based on study arm, duration of HIV-seronegative follow-up, and time of cohort enrolment. Blinded investigators assayed the ability at enrolment of genital IgA to neutralize primary HIV isolates as well as systemic HIV-specific cellular IFNgamma-modified enzyme-linked immunospot and proliferative responses.\n",
      "The study cohort comprised 113 FSWs: 24 cases who acquired HIV and 89 matched controls. Genital HIV-neutralizing IgA was associated with reduced HIV acquisition (P = 0.003), as was HIV-specific proliferation (P = 0.002), and these associations were additive. HIV-specific IFNgamma production did not differ between case and control groups. In multivariable analysis, HIV-neutralizing IgA and HIV-specific proliferation each remained independently associated with lack of HIV acquisition. Genital herpes (HSV2) was associated with increased HIV risk and with reduced detection of HIV-neutralizing IgA.\n",
      "Genital HIV-neutralizing IgA and systemic HIV-specific proliferative responses, assayed by blinded investigators, were prospectively associated with HIV nonacquisition. The induction of these immune responses may be an important goal for HIV vaccines.\n",
      "To validate the BED capture enzyme immunoassay for HIV-1 subtype C and to derive adjustments facilitating estimation of HIV-1 incidence from cross-sectional surveys.\n",
      "Laboratory analysis of archived plasma samples collected in Zimbabwe.\n",
      "Serial plasma samples from 85 women who seroconverted to HIV-1 during the postpartum year were assayed by BED and used to estimate the window period between seroconversion and the attainment of a specified BED absorbance. HIV-1 incidences for the year prior to recruitment and for the postpartum year were calculated by applying the BED technique to HIV-1-positive samples collected at baseline and at 12 months.\n",
      "The mean window for an absorbance cut-off of 0.8 was 187 days. Among women who were HIV-1 positive at baseline and retested at 12 months, a proportion (epsilon) 5.2% (142/2749) had a BED absorbance < 0.8 at 12 months and were falsely identified as recent seroconverters. Consequently, the estimated BED annual incidence at 12 months postpartum (7.6%) was 2.2 times the contemporary prospective estimate. BED incidence adjusted for epsilon was 3.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-4.5], close to the 3.4% estimated prospectively. Adjusted BED incidence at baseline was 6.0% (95% CI, 5.2-6.9) and, like the prospective estimates, declined with maternal age. Unadjusted BED incidence estimates were largely independent of age; the pooled estimate was 58% higher than adjusted incidence.\n",
      "The BED method can be used in an African setting, but further estimates of epsilon and of the window period are required, using large samples in a variety of circumstances, before its general utility can be gauged.\n",
      "The high prevalence of anaemia and the increased morbidity and mortality associated with anaemia during AIDS has been well described yet there has been little information about anaemia and changes in haemoglobin levels during acute and early HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "HIV-negative women (n = 245) were enrolled into an observational cohort as part of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) Acute Infection Study. Acute infection was diagnosed following a positive HIV RNA PCR in the absence of antibodies, or detection of HIV-1 antibodies within 3 months of a previously negative antibody test. Haemotologic parameters were assessed before infection and at regular intervals in the first twelve months of HIV infection.\n",
      "Fifty-seven participants with acute HIV infection were identified at a median of 14.5 days post-infection (range 10-81) and were enrolled in the CAPRISA Acute Infection cohort at a median of 41 days post-infection (range 15-104). Mean haemoglobin prior to HIV-1 infection was 12.7 g/dL, with a mean decline of 0.46 g/dL following infection. The prevalence of anaemia increased from 25.0% prior to HIV-1 infection to 52.6% at 3 months post-infection, 61.1% at 6 months post-infection, and 51.4% at 12 months post-infection.\n",
      "Haematologic derangements and anaemia with a trend towards iron deficiency are common with acute HIV-1 subtype C infection in this small cohort. The negative impact of anaemia concurrent with established HIV infection upon morbidity and mortality has been well documented but the prognostic potential and long-term effects of anaemia during acute HIV-1 infection remain unknown.\n",
      "Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that both robust neutralizing antibodies and potent cellular responses play important roles in controlling primary HIV-1 infection. In this study we have investigated the induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses to HIV gp120 monomer immunogen administered intranasally in a novel, oil-in-water nanoemulsion (NE) adjuvant. Mice and guinea pigs intranasally immunized by the application of recombinant HIV gp120 antigen mixed in NE demonstrated robust serum anti-gp120 IgG, as well as bronchial, vaginal, and serum anti-gp120 IgA in mice. The serum of these animals demonstrated antibodies that cross-reacted with heterologous serotypes of gp120 and had significant neutralizing activity against two clade-B laboratory strains of HIV (HIVBaL and HIVSF162) and five primary HIV-1 isolates. The analysis of gp120-specific CTL proliferation, INF-gamma induction, and prevalence of anti-gp120 IgG2 subclass antibodies indicated that nasal vaccination in NE also induced systemic, Th1-polarized cellular immune responses. This study suggests that NE should be evaluated as a mucosal adjuvant for multivalent HIV vaccines.\n",
      "HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is important for prevention, detection and treatment of HIV infection. A study was conducted to determine the extent of utilization of VCT, and to study the attitudes and preferences of the community regarding VCT.\n",
      "A total of 301 adults, aged 18-49 years, residing in Nakuru, Kenya were randomly selected using a two-stage sampling process. A self-administered questionnaire delivered during home visits was used to collect data over a 4-week period.\n",
      "The majority of study participants (184 of 287; 64.1%) had never been tested for HIV; 77 (26.8%) had received VCT, and 26 (9.1%) had received HIV testing without counselling. A total of 219 (78.2%) of the 280 responding participants expressed readiness to have VCT. The majority of participants (216 of 296; 73%) preferred VCT, while 46 (15.5%) preferred testing without counselling. The majority (227; 76.7%) preferred couple testing and dedicated clinics and private doctors' offices as testing facilities. The choice of a nearby facility was ranked above the provision of anonymity by most participants (162 of 298; 54.4%; vice versa for 136 of 298; 45.6%).\n",
      "With HIV/AIDS continuing to be a major public health concern in Kenya, the issues surrounding acceptance and use of VCT need to be addressed. Enhancing community awareness of the benefits of early HIV diagnosis, providing couple-based VCT as an integral part of VCT and increasing access to VCT testing sites may enhance utilization of VCT.\n",
      "Clinical signs and symptoms of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants are not well characterized.\n",
      "Serial clinical assessments and HIV PCR assays were conducted in a cohort of children born to HIV-seropositive mothers from birth to 2 years of age. Acute HIV infection visits were defined as those up to 3 months prior to and including the visit at which HIV DNA was first detected. Noninfection visits included all visits at which the child had test results negative for HIV, including the last visit at which a test result negative for HIV DNA was obtained in children who later acquired HIV infection. Differences in the prevalence of symptoms at acute infection versus noninfection visits were determined overall and were stratified by age at infection (<2 months vs. >or=2 months). HIV RNA was measured serially in infected infants and was compared between infants with and infants without symptoms of acute HIV infection.\n",
      "There were 125 acute infection visits (among 56 infants) and 3491 noninfection visits (among 306 infants). Acute HIV infection was associated with rash (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.8), failure to thrive (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5), and lymphadenopathy (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.8). Acute HIV infection was associated with lymphadenopathy (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.0) in infants <2 months of age and with pneumonia (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.3) and dehydration (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.9-18.5) in infants >or=2 months of age. Infant peak viral load and mortality were not associated with symptoms of acute HIV infection. However, infants with symptoms had higher viral levels later in the course of infection than did those without symptoms (P=.05).\n",
      "Infants may manifest symptoms early during the course of HIV infection, and symptoms of acute HIV infection may correlate with poor viral control. Rash, failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, and dehydration may signify acute HIV infection in infants.\n",
      "Female sex workers (FSWs) form a core group at high risk of both sexual HIV acquisition and secondary transmission. The magnitude of these risks may vary by sexual risk taking, partner HIV prevalence, host immune factors and genital co-infections. We examined temporal trends in HIV prevalence and per-act incidence, adjusted for behavioral and other variables, in FSWs from Nairobi, Kenya.\n",
      "An open cohort of FSWs followed since 1985. Behavioral and clinical data were collected six monthly from 1985 to 2005, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnostics and HIV serology performed. A Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariables was used to estimate infection risk as a function of calendar time.\n",
      "HIV prevalence in new FSW enrollees peaked at 81% in 1986, and was consistently below 50% after 1997. Initially uninfected FSWs remained at high risk of acquiring HIV throughout the study period, but the rate of HIV acquisition during unprotected sex with a casual client declined by over four-fold. This reduction correlated closely with decreases in gonorrhea prevalence, and predated reductions in the Kenyan HIV population prevalence by over a decade.\n",
      "The per-act rate of HIV acquisition in high-risk Nairobi FSWs fell dramatically between 1985 and 2005. This decline may represent the impact of improved STI prevention/therapy, immunogenetic shifts in at-risk women, or changes in the proportion of HIV exposures occurring with clients who had acute HIV infection. Declining HIV incidence in high-risk cohorts may predict and/or be causally related to future reductions in population prevalence.\n",
      "Individuals with acute (preseroconversion) HIV infection (AHI) are important in the spread of HIV. The identification of AHI requires the detection of viral proteins or nucleic acids with techniques that are often unaffordable for routine use. To facilitate the efficient use of these tests, we sought to develop a risk score algorithm for identifying likely AHI cases and targeting the tests towards those individuals.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study of 1448 adults attending a sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic in Malawi.\n",
      "Using logistic regression, we identified risk behaviors, symptoms, HIV rapid test results, and STI syndromes that were predictive of AHI. We assigned a model-based score to each predictor and calculated a risk score for each participant.\n",
      "Twenty-one participants (1.45%) had AHI, 588 had established HIV infection, and 839 were HIV-negative. AHI was strongly associated with discordant rapid HIV tests and genital ulcer disease (GUD). The algorithm also included diarrhea, more than one sexual partner in 2 months, body ache, and fever. Corresponding predictor scores were 1 for fever, body ache, and more than one partner; 2 for diarrhea and GUD; and 4 for discordant rapid tests. A risk score of 2 or greater was 95.2% sensitive and 60.5% specific in detecting AHI.\n",
      "Using this algorithm, we could identify 95% of AHI cases by performing nucleic acid or protein tests in only 40% of patients. Risk score algorithms could enable rapid, reliable AHI detection in resource-limited settings.\n",
      "Accurate estimates of the probability of HIV transmission during various stages of infection are needed to inform epidemiological models. Very limited information is available about the probability of transmission during acute HIV infection. We conducted a secondary analysis of published data from the Rakai, Uganda seroconversion study. Mathematical and computer-based models were used to quantify the per-act and per-partnership transmission probabilities during acute and chronic HIV infection, and to estimate how many of the transmission events reported in the Rakai study were due to acute-phase HIV transmission. The average per-act transmission probability during acute infection equaled 0.03604 vs. 0.00084 for chronic HIV infection. Overall, HIV was transmitted during acute infection in 46.5% of 23 \"incident index partner couples.\" Acute-phase transmission accounted for 89.1% of all transmission events in the first 20 months of follow-up. These results highlight the substantial risk of transmission during acute HIV infection.\n",
      "We investigated the association between albumin levels and HIV-1 disease progression among 78 Kenyan women followed from before infection through a median of 70 months. With HIV-1 acquisition, median albumin decreased from 38.5 g/liter to 36.8 g/liter (p = 0.07) and the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia increased from 16% to 32% (p = 0.02). Each 1 g/liter decrease in albumin with HIV-1 acquisition was associated with a 13% increase (p = 0.01) in the risk of progressing to a CD4 count <200 cells/mul, after adjustment for set point plasma viral load. A decrease in albumin of over 10% was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in the risk of progressing to a CD4 count <200 cells/mul (95% CI 1.4-9.0, p = 0.008). Trends for an increased risk of mortality were also seen. A greater decrease in albumin levels accompanying HIV-1 acquisition may be a marker for changes in early infection associated with more rapid disease progression.\n",
      "It is commonly assumed that sexual risk factors for heterosexual HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, such as multi-partner sex, paid sex and co-infections, become less important as HIV epidemics mature and prevalence increases.\n",
      "We conducted a systematic review of 68 African epidemiological studies from 1986 to 2006 involving 17,000 HIV positive adults and 73,000 controls. We used random-effects methods and stratified results by gender, time, background HIV prevalence rates and other variables. The number of sex partners, history of paid sex, and infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) or other sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) each showed significant associations with HIV infection. Among the general population, the odds ratio (OR) of HIV infection for women reporting 3+ sex partners versus 0-2 was 3.64 (95%CI [2.87-4.62]), with similar risks for men. About 9% of infected women reported ever having been paid for sex, versus 4% of control women (OR = 2.29, [1.45-3.62]). About 31% of infected men reported ever paying for sex versus 18% of uninfected men (OR = 1.75, [1.30-2.36]). HSV-2 infection carried the largest risk of HIV infection: OR = 4.62, [2.85-7.47] in women, and OR = 6.97, [4.68-10.38] in men. These risks changed little over time and stratification by lower and higher HIV background prevalence showed that risk ratios for most variables were larger in high prevalence settings. Among uninfected controls, the male-female differences in the number of sex partners and in paid sex were more extreme in the higher HIV prevalence settings than in the lower prevalence settings.\n",
      "Multi-partner sex, paid sex, STIs and HSV-2 infection are as important to HIV transmission in advanced as in early HIV epidemics. Even in high prevalence settings, prevention among people with high rates of partner change, such as female sex workers and their male clients, is likely to reduce transmission overall.\n",
      "Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States and Europe has been a tremendous success, such that transmission rates of less than 2% have been achieved. Some key successes have also been demonstrated in resource-poor countries; however, the translation of successful interventions into public health policy has been slow because of a variety of factors such as inadequate funding and cultural, social, and institutional barriers. The issue of HIV and infant feeding in settings that lack culturally acceptable, feasible, affordable, safe, and sustainable nutritional substitutes for breast milk is a continuing dilemma. An effective preventive infant HIV vaccine would be an optimal approach to reduce HIV acquisition in the first year of life among breast-feeding infants. The challenges to eliminate new perinatal HIV infections worldwide will depend on both sustaining and expanding PMTCT interventions and effective primary HIV prevention for women, adolescents, and young adults.\n",
      "This study was conducted to compare viral dynamics in blood and semen between subjects with antibody negative, acute HIV-1 infection and other subjects with later stages of infection.\n",
      "A prospective cohort study was embedded within a cross-sectional study of HIV screening in a Lilongwe, Malawi STD clinic.\n",
      "Blood samples from HIV antibody negative or indeterminate volunteers were used to detect HIV RNA in plasma using a pooling strategy. Blood and seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations were measured over 16 weeks.\n",
      "Sixteen men with acute HIV infection and 25 men with chronic HIV infection were studied. Blood viral load in subjects with acute HIV infection was highest about 17 days after infection (mean +/- SE, 6.9 +/- 0.5 log10 copies/ml), while semen viral load peaked about 30 days after infection (4.5 +/- 0.4 log10 copies/ml). Semen viral load declined by 1.7 log10 to a nadir by week 10 of HIV infection. Semen and blood viral loads were more stable in chronically infected subjects over 16 weeks. Higher semen levels of HIV RNA were noted in subjects with low CD4 cell counts.\n",
      "These results provide a biological explanation for reported increases in HIV transmission during the very early (acute) and late stages of infection. Recognizing temporal differences in HIV shedding in the genital tract is important in the development of effective HIV prevention strategies.\n",
      "We report the first case, to our knowledge, of antibody-negative human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infection, which was identified during screening for acute HIV-1 infection in Botswana. Results of tests for HIV-1 antibodies were consistently negative, including rapid and regular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The nonrecombinant HIV-1 subtype C infection was confirmed by viral genotyping within the gag, pol, and env genes. The period between referral of the patient in a clinically stable condition and AIDS-related death was approximately 3 months. The reported case indicates the importance of studying the prevalence of seronegative HIV-1 infection in southern Africa, where subtype C predominates.\n",
      "HIV-related fatigue is a debilitating and disabling symptom that persists for months and years. In 743 HIV/AIDS patients from Southern Africa, the authors found ratings of HIV-related fatigue to be highly prevalent. The authors conducted a secondary data analysis within the theoretical context of the University of California, San Francisco Symptom Management Model. The analysis focused on 538 patients who reported fatigue to investigate correlates and predictors of fatigue severity in relationship to demographic and HIV/AIDS illness indicators, as well as HIV-specific physical and psychological symptoms. A hierarchical regression model explored the contributions of those five blocks on fatigue severity. Of the 47% of the total variance in fatigue severity, a combination of variables within the health and illness block (6%), the physical symptoms block (7%) and the psychological symptom block (2%) contributed significantly to the increase in fatigue severity scores. Fatigue severity in Southern Africa was moderate, and the factors contributing to the perceived fatigue were most likely related to symptoms of acute HIV disease (such as fever and gastrointestinal problems). In conclusion, fatigue severity is less impacted by demographic or environmental variables but much more by co-occurring symptoms and HIV disease severity. The results of this study imply the need for more research to understand if improvements in water quality and access to food would prevent infection and diarrhea and whether sufficient access to antiretroviral treatments to manage the HIV infection would improve fatigue and co-occurring symptom profiles.\n",
      "Surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) are collectins that have opsonic and immunoregulatory functions, are found in lung fluid and interact with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We compared collectin levels in lung fluid and serum from HIV infected and normal subjects to determine if alterations in lung collectin levels were associated with HIV infection and might result in increased susceptibility to other pulmonary infections.\n",
      "Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected from 19 HIV-infected individuals and 17 HIV-uninfected individuals, all with normal chest X ray at time of study. HIV viral loads and peripheral blood CD4+ T cell counts were measured in all subjects. SP-D was measured in lung fluid, and MBL in both lung fluid and serum.\n",
      "SP-D levels were not significantly different in lung fluid from HIV-uninfected (median 406.72 ng/ml) and HIV-infected individuals with high CD4 count (CD4 >200) (median 382.60 ng/ml) but were elevated in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 count (median 577.79 ng/ml; Kruskall Wallis p < 0.05). MBL levels in serum were not significantly different between HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals (median 1782.70 ng/ml vs 2639.73 ng/ml) and were not detectable in lung fluid.\n",
      "SP-D levels are increased in lung fluid from AIDS patients but not in patients with early HIV infection. MBL levels are not altered by HIV infection or AIDS. There is no evidence that altered pulmonary collectin levels result in susceptibility to infection in these patients.\n",
      "The study of the evolution and specificities of neutralizing antibodies during the course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection may be important in the discovery of possible targets for vaccine design. In this study, we assessed the autologous and heterologous neutralization responses of 14 HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals, using envelope clones obtained within the first 2 months postinfection. Our data show that potent but relatively strain-specific neutralizing antibodies develop within 3 to 12 months of HIV-1 infection. The magnitude of this response was associated with shorter V1-to-V5 envelope lengths and fewer glycosylation sites, particularly in the V1-V2 region. Anti-MPER antibodies were detected in 4 of 14 individuals within a year of infection, while antibodies to CD4-induced (CD4i) epitopes developed to high titers in 12 participants, in most cases before the development of autologous neutralizing antibodies. However, neither anti-MPER nor anti-CD4i antibody specificity conferred neutralization breadth. These data provide insights into the kinetics, potency, breadth, and epitope specificity of neutralizing antibody responses in acute HIV-1 subtype C infection.\n",
      "A cross-sectional study was carried out at a programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) at a public antenatal clinic in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The objectives were to obtain information from women concerning their reactions to HIV test results received through the programme, their experiences with faithfulness to partners as a means of primary HIV prevention for themselves and their infants, their relationships with partners, their own and their partners' experiences with HIV testing, and their knowledge of their partners' HIV serostatus. The participants were a purposive sample of 87 women who had received HIV-1-positive test results and 30 women who had received HIV-1-negative test results through the clinic's programme. Eighty-five per cent of the HIV-positive women were surprised by their test result; 52% of those who tested HIV-negative anticipated that result. Nearly two-thirds of those who were surprised to be HIV-positive and a similar proportion of those who expected to be HIV-negative explained their reactions by referring to faithfulness to their partners. Only five of the 117 women interviewed expressed a belief that their partners were faithful to them; and only two, and none of those who received an HIV-positive test result, reported using condoms with partners. No more than one-fourth of either the HIV-positive or the HIV-negative groups of women had been previously tested for HIV; less than one-fourth of the women in each group reported having partners who had been tested for HIV, or knew their partners' serostatus. Relationship characteristics of some HIV-positive women may have increased their vulnerability to HIV infection. Although being faithful to partners can be effective for the primary prevention of HIV infection, the manner in which it was practiced by many of the women in our study may have further increased their risk of infection. Organisations that choose to fund HIV prevention programmes that promote faithfulness to partners, and the programmes that stress faithfulness, must ensure that women are informed about the conditions that can influence the effectiveness of faithfulness as a protective action. However, women need more than information. Prevention programmes, whether concerned primarily with prevention of MTCT or with HIV prevention more broadly, must promote and elicit cooperation from women's sexual partners to support women's efforts to be tested for HIV, to be tested for HIV themselves, to disclose their test results, to reciprocate women's faithfulness and, if HIV serodiscordant or unwilling to be faithful, to use condoms. These steps may increase the likelihood that women will be able to protect themselves and their infants from HIV infection by being faithful to their partners.\n",
      "The envelope genes of 23 subtype C viral isolates from five individuals with early HIV-1 infection, followed for 2-4 years, were sequenced, analyzed, and correlated to coreceptor usage. Isolates from three participants used the CCR5 coreceptor at all time points, with no significant adaptations in the variable loop lengths, predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, or predicted change in sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies with disease progression. However, two individuals, Du151 and Du179, who had previously been shown to be dually infected with two phylogenetically distinct subtype C strains, were able to use CXCR4 with disease progression. The intraperson genetic diversity was 9% for Du151 and 3% for Du179 compared to <2% for participants who did not undergo a coreceptor switch. In both cases this coreceptor switch was associated with specific amino acid changes in the crown, an increased net amino acid charge in the V3 loop, and an increase in the length of the V1 region.\n",
      "The aim of this article was to describe the epidemiological and clinical aspects of HIV-2 infection in Dakar.\n",
      "This retrospective study was made on 217 HIV-2 infected patients hospitalized between 1986 and 2003; the epidemiological, clinical, and paraclinical data was collected and analyzed using the Epi-Info software version 6.04.\n",
      "The mean age was 40 years+/-9.6 and the male to female sex ratio was 1.33. The mode of transmission was primarily heterosexual. Some risk factors (travel abroad, heterosexual multi-partners, and unprotected sexual intercourse) were more frequently observed in men while others (blood transfusion, HIV positive partners) were noted among HIV-2 infected women. The most frequent symptoms were weight loss (88%), diarrhea (77%), fever (72.4%), asthenia (70.5%), chronic cough, and dermatosis (50.7%). The main opportunistic infections were oral candidiasis (61.8%), tuberculosis (26.3%), intestinal parasitosis (20.3%). The lethality rate was 33.2% and it was correlated with a low CD4 rate. Meningoencephalitis and bacterial infections were associated with a high lethality rate.\n",
      "The epidemiological and clinical aspects of HIV-2 infection were the same as in HIV-1 infected patients. However the lethality rate remained high among patients hospitalized with a low CD4 cell count. Early HIV testing and improving the diagnostic approach for opportunistic infections remains a high priority.\n",
      "We conducted a prospective study to evaluate methods of detecting clients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) who were acutely coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Lilongwe, Malawi.\n",
      "After informed consent was obtained, all clients with acute STDs were offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing by 2 rapid antibody tests. Samples from rapid test-negative or -discordant subjects were pooled (50 : 5 : 1) and tested for HIV RNA. Western blots were performed on all rapid test-discordant specimens with detectable HIV RNA. A subset of specimens received p24 antigen testing with standard and/or ultrasensitive methods. Patients with possible acute HIV infection were followed to confirm seroconversion.\n",
      "A total of 1450 clients (34% female and 66% male) agreed to testing, of whom 588 (40.55%) had established HIV infection and 21 (1.45%) had acute infection. Discordant rapid antibody tests identified 7 of 21 (33.3% sensitivity), standard p24 antigen identified 12 of 16 (75% sensitivity), and ultrasensitive p24 antigen identified 15 of 17 (88% sensitivity) acute cases. By definition, the sensitivity of the RNA assay was 100%.\n",
      "Real-time pooled RNA testing for the detection of acute HIV infection is feasible in resource-limited settings. However, parallel rapid testing and p24 antigen testing are technologically simpler and together may detect approximately 90% of acute cases.\n",
      "\"Centralized\" (ancestral and consensus) HIV-1 envelope immunogens induce broadly cross-reactive T cell responses in laboratory animals; however, their potential to elicit cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies has not been fully explored. Here, we report the construction of a panel of consensus subtype B (ConB) envelopes and compare their biologic, antigenic, and immunogenic properties to those of two wild-type Env controls from individuals with early and acute HIV-1 infection. Glycoprotein expressed from full-length (gp160), uncleaved (gp160-UNC), truncated (gp145), and N-linked glycosylation site deleted (gp160-201N/S) versions of the ConB env gene were packaged into virions and, except for the fusion defective gp160-UNC, mediated infection via the CCR5 co-receptor. Pseudovirions containing ConB Envs were sensitive to neutralization by patient plasma and monoclonal antibodies, indicating the preservation of neutralizing epitopes found in contemporary subtype B viruses. When used as DNA vaccines in guinea pigs, ConB and wild-type env immunogens induced appreciable binding, but overall only low level neutralizing antibodies. However, all four ConB immunogens were significantly more potent than one wild-type vaccine at eliciting neutralizing antibodies against a panel of tier 1 and tier 2 viruses, and ConB gp145 and gp160 were significantly more potent than both wild-type vaccines at inducing neutralizing antibodies against tier 1 viruses. Thus, consensus subtype B env immunogens appear to be at least as good as, and in some instances better than, wild-type B env immunogens at inducing a neutralizing antibody response, and are amenable to further improvement by specific gene modifications.\n",
      "The transfusion of unsafe blood worldwide accounts for 5 to 15% of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. While developed countries now apply PCR testing of pooled samples, some developing countries still do not have universal screening policies. More efficient low-cost procedures for the screening of pooled samples have the potential to encourage mass screening efforts in resource-poor settings. The aim of this study was to estimate the delay in the detection of HIV antibodies in pooled serum samples compared to that in singleton serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to evaluate the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection during the window period. Serial blood samples obtained from five HIV seroconversion panels were mixed with HIV-seronegative blood samples to create pools of 6, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48 samples. The delay in detection of the first anti-HIV antibody-positive sample in tests with pooled samples was calculated for each pool size and compared to that obtained by testing of singleton samples and statistically evaluated by a robust log-linear regression analysis. The risk of a false-negative (FN) result caused by dilution was estimated by use of the incidence risk/window period model. The additional risk of transmission related to ELISA screening of pooled samples for HIV did not exceed 9% of the current risk of an FN result (estimated to be 1/1,067,000). The countries with virus prevalence rates in donors of less than 15% are expected to save up to 30% in the number of tests. ELISA screening of pooled samples could be considered in settings where the testing of blood supplies for HIV is not routinely done.\n",
      "CRF02_AG is the predominant HIV strain circulating in West and West Central Africa. The aim of this study was to test whether this predominance is associated with a higher in vitro replicative fitness relative to parental subtype A and G viruses. Primary HIV-1 isolates (10 CRF02_AG, 5 subtype A and 5 subtype G) were obtained from a well-described Cameroonian cohort. Growth competition experiments were carried out at equal multiplicity of infection in activated T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DC) in parallel.\n",
      "Dual infection/competition experiments in activated T cells clearly indicated that CRF02_AG isolates had a significant replication advantage over the subtype A and subtype G viruses. The higher fitness of CRF02_AG was evident for isolates from patients with CD4+ T cell counts >200 cells/microL (non-AIDS) or CD4+ T cell counts <200 cells/microL (AIDS), and was independent of the co-receptor tropism. In MO-DC cultures, CRF02_AG isolates showed a slightly but not significantly higher replication advantage compared to subtype A or G isolates.\n",
      "We observed a higher ex vivo replicative fitness of CRF02_AG isolates compared to subtype A and G viruses from the same geographic region and showed that this was independent of the co-receptor tropism and irrespective of high or low CD4+ T cell count. This advantage in replicative fitness may contribute to the dominant spread of CRF02_AG over A and G subtypes in West and West Central Africa.\n",
      "There is limited information on the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in Africa, especially from individuals with well-defined dates of infection. We used data from a prospective cohort study of female sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya, who were followed up monthly from before the date of HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "Antiretroviral-naive women who had a well-defined date of HIV-1 infection were included in this analysis. The effects of set point plasma viral load (measured 4-24 months after infection), early CD4+ cell count, and symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection on mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards analysis.\n",
      "Among 218 women, the median duration of follow-up after HIV-1 infection was 4.6 years. Forty women died, and at 8.7 years (the time of the last death), the cumulative survival rate was 51% by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Higher set point viral load, lower early CD4+ cell count, and more-symptomatic acute HIV-1 illness each predicted death. In multivariate analysis, set point viral load (hazard ratio [HR], 2.28 per 1 log10 copies/mL increase; P=.001) and acute HIV-1 illness (HR, 1.14 per each additional symptom; P=.05) were independently associated with higher mortality.\n",
      "Among this group of African women, the survival rate was similar to that for HIV-1-infected individuals in industrialized nations before the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy. Higher set point viral load and more-severe acute HIV-1 illness predicted faster progression to death. Early identification of individuals at risk for rapid disease progression may allow closer clinical monitoring, including timely initiation of antiretroviral treatment.\n",
      "To review the trajectory of Rwanda's HIV epidemic, including long term trends and more recent trends in HIV prevalence, markers of HIV incidence, and behavioural indicators.\n",
      "This paper reviews the history of HIV serological and behavioural surveillance efforts in Rwanda, dating back to the early 1980s, synthesising findings from surveillance, research, and other relevant HIV programmatic data. The documentation reviewed includes published findings, conference abstracts, and unpublished analyses. Special emphasis is given to more recent sentinel surveillance results and data collected using known, documented methods. Recent trends in HIV prevalence were assessed among sites participating in the three most recent consecutive rounds of antenatal clinic sentinel surveillance.\n",
      "Early HIV surveillance in Rwanda documented high HIV prevalence in urban areas with HIV widely disseminated into rural areas by 1986. Between 1988 and 1996, HIV prevalence among pregnant women ranged from 21% to 33% in Kigali, from 8% to 22% in other urban settings, and from 2% to 12% in rural settings. More recent surveillance among pregnant women has demonstrated more moderate prevalence, with urban/rural differences narrowing slightly. Between 1998 and 2003, HIV prevalence may have declined in urban areas, whereas rural areas appear to have remained stable. Age at first sexual intercourse is relatively late in Rwanda (20 years for both males and females) and has remained stable since at least 1992.\n",
      "The present analysis suggests that Rwanda may have experienced declines over the long term in HIV prevalence in urban areas, especially in Kigali, and may have stable or slightly rising HIV prevalence in rural areas. The limited behavioural data available suggest that, on the national level, Rwanda may benefit from a unique combination of low numbers of partners and late sexual debut, which may have had a mitigating effect on HIV prevalence.\n",
      "Recent syphilis outbreaks have raised concern regarding the potential enhancement of HIV transmission. The incidence of syphilis and its association with HIV-1 infection rates among a cohort of sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic attendees was investigated.\n",
      "2732 HIV-1 seronegative patients attending three STI and one gynaecology clinic, were enrolled from 1993-2000 in an ongoing prospective cohort study of acute HIV-1 infection in Pune, India. At screening and quarterly follow up visits, participants underwent HIV-1 risk reduction counselling, risk behaviour assessment and HIV/STI screening that included testing for serological evidence of syphilis by RPR with TPHA confirmation. Patients with genital ulcers were screened with dark field microscopy.\n",
      "Among 2324 participants who were HIV-1 and RPR seronegative at baseline, 172 participants were found to have clinical or laboratory evidence of syphilis during follow up (5.4 per 100 person years, 95% CI 4.8 to 6.5 per 100 person years). Independent predictors of syphilis acquisition based on a Cox proportional hazards model included age less than 20 years, lack of formal education, earlier calendar year of follow up, and recent HIV-1 infection. Based on a median follow up time of 11 months, the incidence of HIV-1 was 5.8 per 100 person years (95% CI 5.0 to 6.6 per 100 person years). Using a Cox proportional hazards model to adjust for known HIV risk factors, the adjusted hazard ratio of HIV-1 infection associated with incident syphilis was 4.44 (95% CI 2.96 to 6.65; p<0.001).\n",
      "A high incidence rate of syphilis was observed among STI clinic attendees. The elevated risk of HIV-1 infection that was observed among participants with incident syphilis supports the hypothesis that syphilis enhances the sexual transmission of HIV-1 and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of syphilis.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG is the predominant subtype in Cameroon, even more prevalent than the parental subtypes A and G. An important question that needs to be addressed is whether recombination in HIV-1 infection can lead to the emergence of viruses with biological advantages. The replicative capacity was investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 13 R5-tropic primary HIV-1 isolates, including 5 CRF02_AG, 4 subtype A, and 4 subtype G viruses. HIV-1 subtype identity was defined by phylogeny either of the full-length genome or analysis of a combination of segments of the gag, pro, pol, and env genes followed by recombination breakpoint analysis. All viruses were grown on PBMCs for 11 days and culture supernatant was analyzed for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and p24 production. On day 11 post-infection, CRF02_AG strains had a 1.4-1.9 times higher RT activity and reached a significantly higher level of p24 production than the parental subtypes A and G. Furthermore, the replication rate as measured by p24 production was 1.4 times higher for CRF02_AG strains compared to the subtypes A and G. This study suggests that the recombination event that led to CRF02_AG resulted in a variant with a better replicative capacity than its progenitors. This adaptation could contribute to the broader spread of HIV-1 CRF02_AG leading to its predominance in West Central Africa compared to the lower prevalence of its parental subtypes A and G.\n",
      "A recent report from a PMTCT implementation study in Mombasa, Kenya, points at an important gap between the efficacy in clinical trial circumstances and the effectiveness of PMTCT programmes when implemented in real life. Hence, the quality and quantity of antenatal HIV counselling in a routine setting were appraised. The counsellors' social and communicative skills, duration and topics covered during pre- and post-test counselling sessions were assessed by means of the VCT assessment tools published by UNAIDS. A total of 14 group educational sessions, 66 pre-test counselling sessions and 50 post-test counselling sessions were observed and assessed. In general, the frequency and duration of the counselling was low. Crucial topics such as window period and partner involvement and follow-up support were covered haphazardly. The counsellor's social and communicative skills were given high marks, yet information was rarely repeated or summarized. The limited time dedicated to women receiving antenatal VCT contrasts with the heavy and comprehensive load of health information and advice they are supposed to receive. Ample pre- and post-test counselling including follow-up should be pursued for optimal effectiveness of PMTCT. We propose a number of health system interventions preceded and guided by ongoing audit.\n",
      "The South African National Blood Service collects more than 700,000 units of blood annually from a population in which 11.4% is infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). The prevalence of HIV-1 in blood donations increased to 0.26% (1:385) in 1998, indicating that a significant number of window-period infective units were entering the blood supply (risk 3.4/100,000).\n",
      "To determine whether the implementation of a new donor selection policy and educational program introduced in 1999 was associated with reductions in the incidence and prevalence of HIV-1 in blood donations and the reduced transmission risk.\n",
      "We compared the prevalence of HIV-1 in 880,534 blood donations collected from 1999 through 2000 with the 791,639 blood donations collected from 2001 through 2002. We estimated the incidence of HIV-1 in 93,378 (1999-2000) and 67,231 (2001-2002) first-time donations and the residual risk for all donations in 2001-2002 using the less-sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay and incidence-window period model.\n",
      "All blood donors in the Inland region of the South African National Blood Service were analyzed.\n",
      "Donor clinics in high HIV prevalence areas were closed. Programs targeting repeat donors and youth were initiated and HIV risk behavior education programs were developed. Structured donor interviews and an enhanced donor self-exclusion questionnaire were institutionalized.\n",
      "The prevalence of HIV-1 in blood donations declined from 0.17% in 1999-2000 to 0.08% in 2001-2002 after the implementation of the new donor selection and education policy. The number of high-risk donations collected decreased from 2.6% to 1.7% (P<.001), and the likelihood of these donations being infected decreased from 4.8% to 3.25%. The likelihood of first-time donors being recently infected with HIV-1 decreased from 18% to 14% (P = .07) and respective incidence of high-risk donations collected decreased from 2.6% to 1.7%. Donations from the majority black population declined from 6.6% to 4.2% (P<.001). Analysis of HIV-1 incidence in 2001-2002 suggests a residual risk of collecting a window period infectious unit of 2.6/100,000.\n",

      "Paediatric HIV infection is predominantly vertically transmitted and 90% of the global burden is carried by Sub Saharan Africa. Diagnosis of HIV infection is important to ensure access to appropriate healthcare. Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes in low resource settings fail to identify HIV-infected children because of high lost to follow-up rates by 12 months of age when HIV testing is performed. The cost of diagnosing HIV infection earlier in infancy was measured.\n",
      "A prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study was conducted in a PMTCT clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa over an 18-month period. From a total of 300 HIV exposed infants enrolled in an infant diagnostic study, a convenience sample of 30 was enrolled in a costing sub-study. Patient and provider costs incurred in establishing the HIV status of an exposed infant were documented to determine the societal and provider cost of performing HIV testing at 6 weeks and 12 months of age.\n",
      "The average societal cost of an earlier diagnosis of HIV is R158 less per patient than current practice as determined from 123 (82%) questionnaires. On average, early diagnosis would cost the provider R8 more per patient. PMTCT clinic attendance figures predict that earlier testing would increase the number of infants diagnosed by almost threefold.\n",
      "A marginal additional investment by government to access an earlier HIV diagnosis for infants could triple the efficacy of PMTCT programmes in identifying HIV-infected children for medical management and improved quality and quantity of life. Early diagnosis offers societal benefits that extend beyond economic savings.\n",
      "To evaluate the hypothesis that parasitic infections that induce T-helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses, such as schistosomiasis, upregulate HIV-1 replication.\n",
      "The effect of concomitant Schistosoma mansoni infection was tested in a primate model of acute and chronic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in rhesus macaques using a novel SHIV strain encoding the R5 env gene of a primary HIV clade C isolate from sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "S. mansoni-infected rhesus macaques and controls were exposed to SHIV to assess the effects of schistosomiasis on acute viral infection. Effects on chronic viral infection were evaluated by exposing virus-infected animals to parasites. S. mansoni infection was confirmed by the presence of parasite eggs in stool and eosinophilia. Viral RNA loads, cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression were measured by real time reverse transcription-PCR.\n",
      "S. mansoni coinfection increased the expression of Th2-associated cytokine responses and SHIV replication during both acute and chronic phases of SHIV infection.\n",
      "These results support the hypothesis that concomitant schistosomiasis upregulates replication of immunodeficiency viruses in coinfected hosts, raising the possibility that parasite-infected individuals may also be more susceptible to acquisition of HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) superinfection refers to the acquisition of another strain by an already infected individual. Here we report a comprehensive genetic analysis of an HIV-1 superinfection acquired heterosexually. The infected individual was in a high-risk cohort in Tanzania, was exposed to multiple subtypes, and was systematically evaluated every 3 months with a fluorescent multi-region genotyping assay. The subject was identified in the window period and was first infected with a complex ACD recombinant strain, became superinfected 6 to 9 months later with an AC recombinant, and was monitored for >2.5 years. The plasma viral load exceeded 400,000 copies/ml during the first 9 months of infection but resolved to the set point of 67,000 copies/ml by 3 months after superinfection; the CD4 cell count was 377 cells/mul at 30 months. Viral diversity was evaluated with techniques designed to fully sample the quasi-species, permitting direct observation of the evolution, temporal fluctuation, and intercompartment dynamics of the initial and superinfecting strains and recombinants derived from them. Within 3 months of superinfection, seven different molecular forms were detected in gag and six were detected in env. The proportions of forms fluctuated widely over time in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, illustrating how challenging the detection of dually infected individuals can be. Strain-specific nested PCR confirmed that the superinfecting strain was not present until the 9 month follow-up. This study further defines the parameters and dynamics of superinfection and will foster appropriate studies and approaches to gain a more complete understanding of risk factors for superinfection and its impact on clinical progression, epidemiology, and vaccine design.\n",
      "In 2000, WHO/UNAIDS recommended co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for persons at early stages of HIV infection (WHO stage > or = 2) in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for initiation of co-trimoxazole in Côte d'Ivoire.\n",
      "Cost-effectiveness analysis with an HIV simulation model using clinical and cost data from a randomized trial of co-trimoxazole in HIV-infected adults.\n",
      "The study included HIV-infected patients in Côte d'Ivoire, with median age 33 years. Thirty-four percent were classified as WHO stage 2, 59% as stage 3, and 7% as stage 4. The mean CD4 cell count was 331 x 10(6) cells/l. The interventions were no prophylaxis, clinical criteria-based co-trimoxazole initiation (early: WHO stage > or = 2; late: WHO stage > or = 3), CD4-based co-trimoxazole initiation (< 500, < 200, < 50 x 10(6) CD4 cells/l). The outcome measures were life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness.\n",
      "The most effective strategy, initiation of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis at WHO stage > or = 2, increased undiscounted life expectancy by 5.2 months, discounted life expectancy by 4.4 months, and lifetime costs by US dollars 60, compared with no prophylaxis. Delaying prophylaxis initiation until WHO stage >or = 3 was less costly and less effective. All CD4-based strategies were dominated. The incremental cost-effectiveness of early versus late co-trimoxazole prophylaxis initiation was US dollars 200/year of life gained. Results were stable despite wide variations in plausible assumptions about bacterial resistance and the prophylaxis efficacy on co-trimoxazole-resistant strains.\n",
      "For HIV-infected adults in Côte d'Ivoire, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is reasonably cost-effective and most effective if initiated when WHO stage > or = 2. Early co-trimoxazole prophylaxis will prevent complications prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation and should be considered an essential component of care for early HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection results in different patterns of viral replication in pediatric compared to adult populations. The role of early HIV-1-specific responses in viral control has not been well defined, because most studies of HIV-1-infected infants have been retrospective or cross-sectional. We evaluated the association between HIV-1-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) release from the cells of infants of 1 to 3 months of age and peak viral loads and mortality in the first year of life among 61 Kenyan HIV-1-infected infants. At 1 month, responses were detected in 7/12 (58%) and 6/21 (29%) of infants infected in utero and peripartum, respectively (P = 0.09), and in approximately 50% of infants thereafter. Peaks of HIV-specific spot-forming units (SFU) increased significantly with age in all infants, from 251/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at 1 month of age to 501/10(6) PBMC at 12 months of age (P = 0.03), although when limited to infants who survived to 1 year, the increase in peak HIV-specific SFU was no longer significant (P = 0.18). Over the first year of life, infants with IFN-gamma responses at 1 month had peak plasma viral loads, rates of decline of viral load, and mortality risk similar to those of infants who lacked responses at 1 month. The strength and breadth of IFN-gamma responses at 1 month were not significantly associated with viral containment or mortality. These results suggest that, in contrast to HIV-1-infected adults, in whom strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in primary infection are associated with reductions in viremia, HIV-1-infected neonates generate HIV-1-specific CD8+-T-cell responses early in life that are not clearly associated with improved clinical outcomes.\n",
      "Few studies have addressed primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is of a predominantly heterosexual character and is caused by different subtypes.

      "Seven hundred fifty-two HIV-negative Senegalese women at high risk for infection were monitored every 3 months for acute/early HIV infection; 26 infections were identified (23 HIV-1 and 3 HIV-2), with an HIV-1 incidence rate of 3.23 cases/person-years observation. Multiple viral-load measurements were taken for all seroconverters.\n",
      "The mean+/-standard deviation viral load for all subjects during the early stage of infection was 4.13+/-0.66 log10 copies/mL, with an overall decrease of 0.22 log10 copies/mL after the early stage; the viral set point was reached after 12 months of infection. Most subjects had relatively low viral loads during the early stage of infection. HIV-1 CRF02_AG-infected women had a significantly higher mean viral load during the early stage of infection (mean +/- SD, 4.45+/-0.60 log(10) copies/mL) than did non-HIV-1 CRF02_AG-infected women (mean+/-SD, 3.78+/-0.46 log(10) copies/mL) (P=.008). None of the subjects reported symptoms consistent with primary HIV-1 infection.\n",
      "Our findings in Senegalese women differ from what have been described for primary HIV-1 infection. Further investigations of primary infections with non-B subtypes are warranted, to better characterize their differences with primary infections with subtype B.\n",
      "Designing an immunogen for effective neutralizing antibody induction against diverse primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a high priority for HIV-1 vaccine development. Soluble gp120 envelope (Env) glycoprotein subunit vaccines elicit high titers of antibodies that neutralize T cell line-adapted (TCLA) strains but the antibodies possess poor neutralizing activity against many primary isolates. Previously, we generated soluble trimeric recombinant gp140 from the HIV-1 primary isolate ADA. Here we compared monomeric ADAgp120 and trimeric ADAgp140 as immunogens for neutralizing antibody responses in guinea pigs. Both immunogens generated a neutralizing antibody response that was detectable against the vaccine strain and several heterologous strains. The magnitude of this response was significantly greater in ADAgp140-immunized animals when measured against the TCLA strain, MN, and the R5 primary isolate, Bal. Two additional isolates (SS1196 and Bx08) were neutralized equally by sera from both groups of animals whereas other isolates were neutralized weakly or not at all. Despite equal titers of V3 loop specific binding antibodies in sera from both groups of animals, neutralization of ADA by sera from gp140-immunized animals was insensitive to the presence of ADA-V3 peptide, whereas addition of this peptide to sera from gp120- immunized animals blocked all detectable neutralizing activity against ADA. These results support the idea that trimeric gp140 is an improved immunogen compared to monomeric gp120 but that additional improvements are required to afford broad protection against a spectrum of heterologous primary HIV-1 isolates. This ADAgp140 immunogen may be considered a starting point from which to engineer additional improvements for cross-reactive neutralizing antibody induction.\n",

In line with trial observations, the projected HIV impacts were larger for the ST intervention in Mwanza than for the MT intervention in Rakai or the IEC and IEC + ST interventions in Masaka. All 4 simulated intervention strategies were more effective in reducing incidence of HIV infection in Mwanza than in either Rakai or Masaka.\n",

This study supports the hypothesis that STD management is an effective HIV prevention strategy in populations with a high prevalence of curable STDs, particularly in an early HIV epidemic.\n",
      "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can increase risk for acquisition and transmission of HIV via a number of mechanisms, including breaching of mechanical barriers to infection, increased inflammation and higher levels of HIV cellular targets, and increased genital tract HIV levels. Studies in Malawi clinic populations indicate that treatment of STDs can reduce genital tract HIV levels. Work in Africa and India has indicated that genital herpes infection is associated with increased risk of acquisition of HIV and that presence of genital ulcer disease is associated with increased risk of transmission of HIV disease. Acute HIV infection has been found to be more frequent in individuals with active STDs, and co-transmission may be a common phenomenon. Acute HIV infection, which is not currently routinely diagnosed, is associated with increased risk of transmission. Greater efforts are needed in identifying acute HIV infection in STD clinics. This article summarizes a presentation by Myron S. Cohen, MD, at the International AIDS Society-USA course in Chicago in May.\n",
      "HIV contributes substantially to child mortality, but factors underlying these deaths are inadequately described. With individual data from seven randomised mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) intervention trials, we estimate mortality in African children born to HIV-infected mothers and analyse selected risk factors.\n",
      "Early HIV infection was defined as a positive HIV-PCR test before 4 weeks of age; and late infection by a negative PCR test at or after 4 weeks of age, followed by a positive test. Mortality rate was expressed per 1000 child-years. We investigated the effect of maternal health, infant HIV infection, feeding practices, and age at acquisition of infection on mortality assessed with Cox proportional hazards models, and allowed for random effects for trials grouped geographically.\n",
      "378 (11%) of 3468 children died. By age 1 year, an estimated 35.2% infected and 4.9% uninfected children will have died; by 2 years of age, 52.5% and 7.6% will have died, respectively. Mortality varied by geographical region, and was associated with maternal death (adjusted odds ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.62-3.19), CD4+ cell counts <200 per microL (1.91, 1.39-2.62), and infant HIV infection (8.16, 6.43-10.33). Mortality was not associated with either ever breastfeeding and never breastfeeding in either infected or uninfected children. In infected children, mortality was significantly lower for those with late infection than those with early infection (0.52, 0.39-0.70). This effect was also seen in analyses of survival from the age at infection (0.74, 0.55-0.99).\n",
      "These findings highlight the necessity for timely antiretroviral care, for support for HIV-infected women and children in developing countries, and for assessment of prophylactic programmes to prevent MTCT, including child mortality and infection averted.\n",
      "The identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) able to neutralize primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from different subtypes may help in our understanding of the mechanisms of virus entry and neutralization and in the development of entry inhibitors and vaccines. For enhanced selection of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs proteins) from two isolates complexed with two-domain soluble CD4 (sCD4) were alternated during panning of a phage-displayed human antibody library; these two Env proteins (89.6 and IIIB gp140s), and one additional Env (JR-FL gp120) alone and complexed with sCD4 were used for screening. An antibody with relatively long HCDR3 (17 residues), designated m14, was identified that bound to all antigens and neutralized heterologous HIV-1 isolates in multiple assay formats. Fab m14 potently neutralized selected well-characterized subtype B isolates, including JRCSF, 89.6, IIIB, and Yu2. Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) m14 was more potent than Fab m14 and neutralized 7 of 10 other clade B isolates; notably, although the potency was on average significantly lower than that of IgG1 b12, IgG1 m14 neutralized two of the isolates with significantly lower 50% inhibitory concentrations than did IgG1 b12. IgG1 m14 neutralized four of four selected clade C isolates with potency higher than that of IgG1 b12. It also neutralized 7 of 17 clade C isolates from southern Africa that were difficult to neutralize with other hMAbs and sCD4. IgG1 m14 neutralized four of seven primary HIV-1 isolates from other clades (A, D, E, and F) much more efficiently than did IgG1 b12; for the other three isolates, IgG b12 was much more potent. Fab m14 bound with high (nanomolar range) affinity to gp120 and gp140 from various isolates; its binding was reduced by soluble CD4 and antibodies recognizing the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on gp120, and its footprint as defined by alanine-scanning mutagenesis overlaps that of b12. These results suggest that m14 is a novel CD4bs cross-reactive HIV-1-neutralizing antibody that exhibits a different inhibitory profile compared to the only known potent broadly neutralizing CD4bs human antibody, b12, and may have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of immune evasion and for the development of inhibitors and vaccines.\n",
      "African women frequently acquire several genetically distinct human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants from a heterosexual partner, whereas the acquisition of multiple variants appears to be rare in men. To determine whether newly infected individuals in other risk groups acquire genetically diverse viruses, we examined the viral envelope sequences in plasma samples from 13 women and 4 men from the United States infected with subtype B viruses and 10 men from Kenya infected with non-subtype B viruses. HIV-1 envelope sequences differed by more than 2% in three U.S. women, one U.S. man, and one Kenyan man near the time of seroconversion. These findings suggest that early HIV-1 genetic diversity is not exclusive to women from Africa or to infection with any particular HIV-1 subtype.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates derived from HIV-infected, treatment-naive Ugandan infants were propagated and tested for sensitivity to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Although most subtype A and D isolates displayed inhibition profiles similar to those of subtype B strains, a subtype D isolate identified as D14-UG displayed high-level resistance to nevirapine in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures (>2,000-fold) and in MT4 cell cultures ( approximately 800-fold) but weaker resistance to delavirdine ( approximately 13-fold) and efavirenz ( approximately 8-fold) in MT4 cell cultures. To investigate the possible mechanism for this resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs), the RT coding region in pol was sequenced and compared to the consensus RT sequence of NNRTI-resistant and NNRTI-sensitive subtype A, B, and D HIV-1 isolates. D14-UG did not contain the classic amino acid substitutions conferring NNRTI resistance (e.g., Y181C, K103N, and G190A) but did have some putative sites associated with drug resistance, I135L, T139V, and V245T. Wild-type and mutated protease-RT genes from D14-UG and an NNRTI-sensitive subtype D isolate from Uganda (D13-UG) were cloned into pNL4-3 to produce recombinant viruses and to determine the effects of the mutations on susceptibility to ARV drugs, specifically, NNRTIs. The results showed that I135L and/or V245T mutations can confer high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine as well as low level cross-resistance to efavirenz. Finally, ex vivo fitness analyses suggested that NNRTI-resistant sites 135L and 245T in wild-type isolate D14-UG may reduce RT fitness but do not have an impact on the fitness of the primary HIV-1 isolate.\n",
      "Acute (antibody-negative) HIV infection is associated with high transmission potential but is rarely recognized.\n",
      "Cross-sectional study.\n",
      "We examined the prevalence and predictors of acute HIV infection among 1361 consecutive male outpatients attending sexually transmitted disease (STD; n = 929) and dermatology (n = 432) clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi. Serum specimens negative for HIV antibodies were screened by HIV RNA PCR using a highly specific pooling/resolution testing algorithm.\n",
      "Five-hundred and fifty-three men (40.6%) were HIV antibody positive and 24 (1.8%) had acute HIV infection; 23 of 24 acutely infected men were from the STD clinic, where they represented 4.5% of all HIV antibody-negative men and 5.0% of all HIV infections. HIV RNA levels for acutely infected men were significantly higher [median (interquartile range), 6.10 (5.19-6.54) log10 HIV RNA copies/ml] than for 58 HIV antibody-positive men [4.42 (3.91-4.95) log10 copies/ml; P < 0.0001]. The factor most strongly associated with acute HIV infection was STD clinic attendance: (odds ratio, 15.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.04-113.0). In multivariate analysis considering only STD patients, factors associated with acute HIV infection included inguinal adenopathy, genital ulceration and age 24-26 years, the age stratum associated with peak incidence of HIV infection among Malawian men.\n",
      "Traditional HIV antibody tests alone are not sufficient to exclude HIV infection among men with acute STD in Malawi due to a surprising proportion of acute HIV infections in this population. Alternative screening methods are required for diagnosis of acute HIV infection; such screening could be important for research and for prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV in select populations.\n",
      "Our previous studies have shown that the majority of African women were infected with multiple HIV-1 genetic variants, while in the remaining women only a single viral genotype was detected early in infection. Infection with multiple viral variants was associated with higher plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and faster CD4 T-cell decline.\n",
      "Socio-behavioral characteristics, use of hormonal contraceptives, and the presence of sexually transmitted diseases were prospectively assessed at approximately monthly intervals around the time of HIV-1 acquisition in female sex workers in Kenya. We assessed the relationship between these factors and HIV-1 genetic complexity early in infection.\n",
      "One hundred and fifty-six women were included in this analysis, of whom 89 had multiple viral genotypes and 67 had a single genotype at primary infection. Women with multiple variants were more likely to have a genital tract infection [odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-18.1] or to be using hormonal contraceptives (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6) at the time of their infection than those with a single variant. In multivariate analyses, these factors were independent predictors of early HIV-1 genetic complexity, and the presence of multiple viral variants early in infection remained significantly associated with a higher steady state plasma HIV-1 RNA level.\n",
      "The presence of genital tract infections and hormonal contraceptive use at the time of transmission were associated with the acquisition of multiple HIV-1 variants.\n",
      "Serological methods based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests for detecting the presence of antibodies against the human immune deficiency virus are the standard techniques for identifying infected blood donors. However, these tests could not detect infected seronegative donors who were in the window period at the time of donation. Such donors can be identified by more elaborate methods including antigen detecting ELISA and polymerase chain reaction, which can detect viral antigens and nucleic acids in infected donor blood even in window period. In addition, the process of donor selection whereby individuals who were at high risk for HIV infections were excluded from the donor panel had substantially reduced the risk of window period donation. Furthermore, in order to ensure greater safety, transfusion centers nowadays undertake additional measures in the form of virucidal techniques such as the use of heat, detergents and photochemical agents to treat blood and blood products. Despite all of these measures, a risk-free transfusion was not practically achievable. However, risk-free transfusion is now possible with the introduction of recombinant blood products, the use of which is severely limited by their cost. Nonetheless, a risk-free transfusion is still achievable at a relatively little cost by transfusing suitably eligible patients with their own blood through the autologous blood transfusion program. Antibody testing is virtually the only method currently available in Nigerian blood banks. There is the need to reactivate and expand the scope of our National Blood Transfusion Service in order to make our blood and products safer.\n",
      "The existence of multiple groups of HIV-1 and HIV-2 suggests that zoonotic transmissions of SIV have occurred at a low rate for centuries. Hence, an increase in the rate of human-to-human transmission may be necessary and sufficient to explain the emergence of HIV as an epidemic in the twentieth century. Three common hypotheses to explain accelerated transmission are (1) social changes accelerated sexual transmission, (2) health care changes accelerated parenteral transmission, and (3) serial passaging adapted HIV for persistent infection and sexual transmission. These hypotheses can be compared to a range of evidence. Temporal and geographic discontinuities in HIV epidemic growth are not easily explained by supposed increases in sexual transmission over time. Large historic changes in sexual transmission are hard to explain based on weak evidence associating HIV prevalence in African communities with differences in sexual behavior. On the other hand, documented iatrogenic outbreaks show high rates of parenteral transmission. The distribution of hepatitis C virus infections and the history of multiinjection treatment for trypanosomiasis in Central Africa suggest widespread parenteral transmission of blood-borne viruses during 1920-1940, coinciding in time and place with the early HIV epidemic. This suggests an important role for parenteral transmission in the early spread of HIV. Further research could improve our understanding of the early HIV epidemic.\n",
      "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals develop a genetically diverse virus population over time, but often only a limited number of viral variants are transmitted from a chronic carrier to a newly infected person. Interestingly, many women but few men are infected by multiple HIV-1 variants from a single partner. To determine whether the complexity of the infecting virus population influences clinical outcome, we examined viral diversity in the HIV-1 envelope sequences present at primary infection in 156 women from Kenya for whom we had follow-up data on viral RNA levels and CD4 T-cell counts. Eighty-nine women had multiple viral genotypes, while 67 women had a single genotype at primary infection. Women who acquired multiple viral genotypes had a significantly higher viral load (median, 4.84 versus 4.64 log(10) copies/ml, P = 0.04) and a significantly lower CD4(+)-T-cell count (median, 416 versus 617 cells/mm(3), P = 0.01) 4 to 24 months after infection compared to women who were infected with a single viral genotype. These studies suggest that early HIV-1 genetic diversity is linked to faster disease progression.\n",

      "Tygerberg Hospital, the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Stellenbosch during a 15-week period from 4 February to 19 May 2002.\n",
      "One hundred and thirty-six student interns (SIs), i.e. final-year medical students.\n",
      "All Sis received a questionnaire and a letter motivating them to participate in the study and explaining the procedure. Regular class meetings enabled continuous motivation and ongoing update. In the case of an incident during the 15-week period, the SI filled in the form and placed it in a sealed drop-off box.\n",
      "Specific focus on the preceding events and the situation in which the incidents occurred (department, time of day, procedure performed, and whether the student was on call), exposure to HIV (patient's retroviral status), use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (whether used, when initiated), and the consequences of the exposure (emotional, on sexual behaviour during the window period, and on career choice).\n",
      "During the 15-week period, 19 incidents were reported; the majority occurred while students were on call, almost half occurred after hours, and a disproportionate number occurred in three departments.\n",
      "Occupational blood exposure is a very real problem and poses a significant risk. SI suggestions should be considered in improving the prevention and management of such incidents.\n",
      "Based on our previous analysis of HIV-1 isolates from Cameroon, we constructed a full-length infectious molecular clone from a primary isolate belonging to the CRF02.AG group of recombinant viruses which dominate the HIV-epidemic in West and Central Africa. The virus derived by transfection of the proviral clone pBD6-15 replicated with similar efficiency compared to its parental isolate and used CXCR4 as coreceptor as well. Furthermore, HIV-1 BD6-15 exhibited similar replication properties and virus yield as the reference B-type HIV-1 strain NL4-3. Sequence analysis revealed open reading frames for all structural and accessory genes apart from vpr. Phylogenetic and bootscanning analyses confirmed that BD6-15 clusters with CRF02.AG recombinant strains from West and Central Africa with similar cross-over points as described for the CRF02.AG prototype strain lbNG. Thus, pBD6-15 represents the first non-subtype B infectious molecular clone of a fast replicating, high producer, X4-tropic primary HIV-1 isolate, which had only been briefly passaged in primary cells.\n",
      "Six divergent HIV-1 partial env and gag genome sequences have been characterized in five subjects in Malawi, from whom blood spot samples were collected between 1982 and 1989, at the time that the AIDS epidemic there was starting. These sequences could not be classified with any of the recognized subtypes or circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1. They showed no consistent and/or supported associations with other subtypes by either env or gag gene phylogenetic analysis. Their genetic distances from defined subtypes suggest that they may be diverse subsubtype C viruses or, alternatively, that they may have mosaic genomes. Bootscanning analyses are consistent with their being mosaic viruses. These sequences highlight early HIV-1 diversity in a population otherwise dominated by subtype C.\n",
      "Domestic smoke exposure and early HIV infection are critical but unseen risk factors for pneumonia. This paper reviews how recent research in Malawi and elsewhere contributes to an understanding of the possible immunological mechanisms underlying these risks.\n",
      "Progressive changes have been reported in lymph nodes in HIV infection, but few accounts describe altered splenic histology at different stages of the disease. Investigation of splenic changes accompanying the progressive CD4+ T-cell depletion that occurs in HIV infection could shed light on normal immunological interactions in this organ. Therefore, we assessed the amount and distribution of lymphoid tissue in spleens from adults with documented early or advanced HIV disease.\n",
      "Immunohistochemistry was used to study splenic tissue collected in an extensive autopsy survey of HIV+ adults in West Africa. Compared with post-mortem spleens from HIV- West African adults and control UK spleens, those from HIV-infected patients showed severe atrophy of white pulp B- and T-cell compartments. In early and advanced HIV disease, marginal zone atrophy was significant. Peri-arteriolar lymphoid sheaths contained increased numbers of CD8+/CD45RO+ T-cells in advanced HIV disease. In red pulp, early and advanced cases showed a lymphocytosis of CD8+/CD45RO- T-lymphocytes.\n",
      "Atrophic changes were more extreme in advanced than early HIV infection. Reduced marginal zone function possibly explains the known predisposition of HIV+ patients to infection by encapsulated bacteria. Possible immunological consequences of these CD8+/CD45RO+ (peri-arteriolar lymphoid sheaths) and CD8+/CD45RO- (red pulp) responses deserve further study. Comparison of West African and UK control spleens indicated that there were no major ethnic differences in spleen structure to prevent extrapolation of our results to European adults.\n",

      "Matched case-control study performed retrospectively within the ANRS 049 DITRAME project conducted in 1995-1998 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.\n",
      "Cases were children infected by HIV-1 postnatally through breastfeeding. All were HIV-1 negative by DNA PCR at least 45 days of age, but positive on a subsequent sample. This period was considered as surrounding the estimated date of postnatal contamination. Signs/symptoms occurring within this period were recorded in cases and compared with those occurring during the same time period in uninfected breastfed children (controls). For cases, plasma specimens were tested for HIV-1 plasma RNA using the branched DNA assay.\n",
      "Of 22 infants infected postnatally (median age at first positive sample, 185 days; range, 87-373 days), 21 (95.5%) exhibited at least one clinical sign, compared with only 27 of the 44 (61.4%) uninfected children (P = 0.003). Three independent factors were associated with primary HIV-1 infection: mononucleosis-like syndrome [odds ratio (OR), 8.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-47.8], dermatitis (OR, 6.0; CI, 1.1-31.9), and generalized lymphadenopathy (OR, 26.5; CI, 2.0-348.4). Among cases, initial median plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 5.92 log10 copies/ml; this declined to 4.96 log10 12 months after the first positive viral load.\n",

      "To examine relationships between diarrhoea, CD4 cell counts and stool pathogens in a community-based cohort of HIV-infected adults in Uganda.\n",
      "Stool specimens, obtained between October 1995 and December 1997, were linked to patients' symptoms and laboratory results. The relationship between CD4 counts and symptoms was tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and those between organisms and diarrhoea using first a univariate Mantel-Haenszel analysis and then a logistic regression model adjusted for CD4 count and multiple organisms.\n",
      "1,213 HIV-infected individuals (70% women, median CD4 cell count at enrollment 215 cells/microl) were followed for 1,224 person years of observation (pyo). 484 stool samples were examined, 357 from patients with diarrhoea. The rate of diarrhoea was 661 episodes per 1,000 pyo. CD4 counts were significantly lower in individuals with diarrhoea than those without (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Forty-nine percent of diarrhoeal stools and 39% of stools from asymptomatic patients contained enteric pathogens. The most frequent isolates were helminths (29.5% of all stools), followed by bacteria (19.2%) and then protozoa (8.9%). Rates of isolation of diarrhoea-associated pathogens were 29% from diarrhoeal stools and 17% from asymptomatic stools (P = 0.01, chi(2) test). The association between diarrhoea and infection with bacteria or protozoa was weak and there was no association with helminths. Cryptosporidium parvum infection alone was associated with low CD4 counts.\n",
      "Diarrhoea was common and most strongly associated with low CD4 counts. Bacteria were frequently found, even in stools from asymptomatic individuals. Over two-thirds of diarrhoeal episodes were undiagnosed, suggesting that unidentified agents or primary HIV enteropathy are important causes of diarrhoea in this population.\n",
      "Between 1997 and 2001, 1624 Ethiopian factory workers were enrolled in prospective HIV-1 cohorts in Ethiopia, at Akaki and Wonji towns. HIV-1 seroprevalence at intake was 11.8% (Akaki) and 7.1% (Wonji). HIV-1 incidence was .75 per 100 person-years (Akaki) and .35 per 100 person-years (Wonji). During follow up, CD4 T-cell counts remained significantly lower and CD8 T-cell counts significantly higher in Ethiopian seroconverters compared with Dutch seroconverters. Viral loads were lower in Ethiopian seroconverters versus Dutch seroconverters in the first months after seroconversion, subsequently increasing to similar levels. All 20 Ethiopian seroconverters were infected with HIV-1 subtype C (15 with sub-cluster C' and 5 with sub-cluster C). Viral loads were higher in sub-cluster C'-infected Ethiopian seroconverters. One subject demonstrated a window period of at least 204 days, combined with a high preseroconversion viral load and no decline of CD4 T cells over a follow-up period of at least 3 years.\n",
      "We evaluated the association between the severity of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) illness and HIV-1 plasma virus load before seroconversion using stored plasma samples obtained from 74 prostitutes in Mombasa, Kenya. Fever, vomiting, headache, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, sore throat, skin rash, or being too sick to work were each associated with significantly higher virus loads before HIV-1 seroconversion, and each additional symptom or sign was associated with an increase in virus load of 0.4 log(10) copies/mL.\n",
      "The sensitivity of one ELISA method, six HIV-1/HIV-2 rapid screening tests, and one confirmatory test was evaluated in comparison with a third-generation EIA method (taken as the 'gold standard') and Western blot on well-characterized panels of sera. HIV diversity was represented by 50 HIV-1 group M subtype A to H, nine HIV-1 group O, 12 HIV-2, two HIV1+2 positive and six indeterminate Western blot profiles. Sensitivity during HIV-1 seroconversion was studied on 39 serial samples collected from six patients during early primary infection. Serial samples obtained from two primates during experimental primary SIV infection were used to mimic HIV-2 seroconversion samples. The sensitivity ranged from 100 to 94.6% according to the test. During seroconversion, rapid tests became positive 2-8 days later than the third-generation EIA. This reveals a major limitation of rapid tests, which are being recommended for use in developing countries. The lack of sensitivity seen during early HIV-1 seroconversion and/or limited specificity in some of the evaluated tests present serious limitations to their use in countries with high HIV incidence and variability. It is suggested that, as soon as possible, less sensitive rapid tests for blood bank screening should be abandoned in favor of highly sensitive rapid tests and/or more robust, more sensitive and cheaper ELISAs. These results stress the need for better screening tools and specific local evaluations.\n",
      "The distribution of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) clades is evaluated in primary HIV-1 infections (PHIs) occurring through sexual transmission in Lombardia, the Italian region with the highest prevalence/incidence of HIV-1 infections. The two primary inclusion parameters for enrollment were sexual transmission and < 1 year seroconversion. Thirty-four enrolled patients have been analysed so far at the molecular level, to characterize their infecting HIV-1 population. Two HIV-1 genomic regions with different rates of genetic variability, the hypervariable C2-V3 fragment of the env gene and the conserved 5' end of the gag p17, were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and characterized by direct DNA sequence analysis. Pairwise nucleotide alignment and phylogenetic analyses show that, although with a high range of nucleotide variability, 32 out of the 34 HIV-1 isolates identified in this PHI cohort fall under the clade B genotype. The two remaining isolates, detected in a couple formed by a Nigerian woman and her Italian partner, consistently cluster with clade G standards in both sub-genomic regions. The amino acid sequences confirm this classification, showing clade-specific residues both in the V3 and p17 regions. These data suggest that the B clade is still prevalently associated with acute primary HIV-1 infections occurring in Italy through sexual transmission. However, the significant intra-clade variability and the identification of non-B clades strongly indicate the relevance of continuous molecular monitoring of the HIV-1 isolates circulating in Italy, for prognostic evaluations as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "Without going into the details of the devastation that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection causes especially in the developing world, the best hope for changing the course of this epidemic is development of a safe, effective, accessible prophylactic HIV vaccine. While the inaccessibility of potentially neutralising epitopes on primary HIV isolates has hampered the development of envelope-based vaccines, there is a number of new potent technologies capable of inducing high levels of circulating virus-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Our original finding that a successive immunisation with DNA and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccines expressing a common immunogen is a potent way of inducing CD8(+) CTL, which has been since reinforced by us and others, prompted us to test this approach in humans. With the view of proceeding into a high-risk cohort in Kenya for the efficacy trial, we designed the immunogen, termed HIVA, to match the HIV strain responsible locally for over 70% infections. It consists of a consensus clade A gag p24/p17 and a string of clade A-derived CTL epitopes. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated high immunogenicities of both the pTHr.HIVA and MVA.HIVA vaccines. In mice, these induced strong T cells-mediated immune responses which lasted at least 155 days. In rhesus macaques, the prime-boost immunisation elicited T cell responses specific for multiple HIV-derived epitopes. Phase I trials in healthy low-risk volunteers have commenced in Oxford and Nairobi, and the preliminary immunogenicity analysis from the Oxford site indicated that both vaccine components alone induced T cell responses in a majority of volunteers. These results have boosted expectations for the prime-boost vaccinations.\n",
      "Clade C is one of the most prevalent genetic subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the world today and one of the least studied with respect to neutralizing antibodies. Most information on HIV-1 serology as it relates to neutralization is derived from clade B. Clade C primary isolates of HIV-1 from South Africa and Malawi were shown here to resemble clade B isolates in their resistance to inhibition by soluble CD4 and their sensitivity to neutralization by human monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G1b12 and, to a lesser extent, 2F5. Unlike clade B isolates, however, all 16 clade C isolates examined resisted neutralization by 2G12. Infection with clade C HIV-1 in a cohort of female sex workers in South Africa generated antibodies that neutralized the autologous clade C isolate and T-cell-line-adapted (TCLA) strains of clade B. Neutralization of clade B TCLA strains was much more sensitive to the presence of autologous gp120 V3 loop peptides compared to the neutralization of clade C isolates in most cases. Thus, the native structure of gp120 on primary isolates of clade C will likely pose a challenge for neutralizing antibody induction by candidate HIV-1 vaccines much the same as it has for clade B. The autologous neutralizing antibody response following primary infection with clade C HIV-1 in South Africa matured slowly, requiring at least 4 to 5 months to become detectable. Once detectable, extensive cross-neutralization of heterologous clade C isolates from South Africa was observed, suggesting an unusual degree of shared neutralization determinants at a regional level. This high frequency of cross-neutralization differed significantly from the ability of South African clade C serum samples to neutralize clade B isolates but did not differ significantly from results of other combinations of clade B and C reagents tested in checkerboard assays. Notably, two clade C serum samples obtained after less than 2 years of infection neutralized a broad spectrum of clade B and C isolates. Other individual serum samples showed a significant clade preference in their neutralizing activity. Our results suggest that clades B and C are each comprised of multiple neutralization serotypes, some of which are more clade specific than others. The clustering of shared neutralization determinants on clade C primary HIV-1 isolates from South Africa suggests that neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines will have less epitope diversity to overcome at a regional level.\n",
      "The minimum requirement for candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines to enter clinical evaluation in humans should be their demonstrable immunogenicity in non-human primates: induction of antibodies neutralizing primary HIV isolates or elicitation of broad T cell-mediated immune responses. Here, we showed in rhesus macaques that the very same vaccines that had entered clinical trials in Oxford and Nairobi, plasmid pTHr.HIVA DNA and recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara MVA.HIVA in a prime-boost protocol (Hanke & McMichael, Nature Medicine 6, 951-955, 2000), induced cellular immune responses specific for multiple HIV-derived epitopes. This was demonstrated by using the intracellular cytokine staining and ELISPOT assays detecting interferon-gamma and pools of peptides employed in the clinical studies. These results have both boosted our expectations for the performance of these vaccines in humans and increased our confidence about the choice of these assays as the primary readouts in the on-going human trials.\n",
      "A 56-year-old patient from Burkina Faso (Western Africa), living in Switzerland for 12 years, was referred to hospital because of acute onset of severe painful swallowing. He returned from a 3-week visit to his home country 4 weeks prior to admission. CLINICAL FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS: Whereas clinical and radiological findings were normal, routine laboratory testing showed increased parameters of infection. Endoscopy revealed an aphthous esophagitis, suggesting a viral infection. Biopsy confirmed an active erosive esophagitis. Herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus and candida could not be detected in the biopsy specimens (immunohistochemistry, microbiology) and in serum. Both, the anti-HIV screening-test and the Western blot antibody test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were negative on admission. Because of the persistent suspicion for an underlying HIV Infection, a combined HIV p24-antigen/ antibody-test was performed, showing an indeterminate result. Following PCR-based tests for HIV-RNA on days 5 and 12 showed 86 100 and 103 700 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml plasma, respectively, revealing the diagnosis of primary HIV-1 infection. Subsequent serological testing (WB) finally documented HIV-1 antibody seroconversion, showing indeterminate and positive results on days 5 and 19, respectively.\n",
      "Within 5 days all signs of infection returned to normal and as documented by endoscopy on day 12, the esophagitis healed up spontaneously. As the patient intended to go back to his home country and the CD4 cell count was 615 x10(6)/l, no antiviral therapy was initiated.\n",
      "This case report is the first demonstrating an atypical symptomatic primary HIV-infection prior to seroconversion, which presented itself exclusively as an aphthous esophagitis with no symptoms of the classic acute retroviral syndrome. Therefore, each clinical suspicion of an underlying HIV-infection should be followed up carefully, even if the patient presents with unusual symptoms.\n",
      "Although acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first described in the USA in 1981, there is evidence that individual cases occurred considerably earlier in Central Africa, and serological and virological data show human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was present in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as far back as 1959. It is likely that HIV-1 infection in humans was established from cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees, but the circumstances surrounding this zoonotic transfer are uncertain. This presentation will review how causality is established in epidemiology, and review the evidence (a putative ecological association) surrounding the hypothesis that early HIV-1 infections were associated with trials of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the DRC. From an epidemiological standpoint, the OPV hypothesis is not supported by data and the ecological association proposed between OPV use and early HIV/AIDS cases is unconvincing. It is likely that Africa will continue to dominate global HIV and AIDS epidemiology in the near to medium-term future, and that the epidemic will evolve over many decades unless a preventive vaccine becomes widely available.\n",
      "This paper reviews the scientific basis for trials exploring the relation between sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Mwanza in the United Republic of Tanzania and Rakai and Masaka in the Republic of Uganda. The importance of a study's location and explanations for the divergent results of these trials are discussed. The modest effect on STDs seen in the trial of syndromic management in Mwanza, in contrast to the 38% reduction in the incidence of HIV, casts doubt on the underlying hypothesis that treating STDs alone slows the transmission of HIV-1. According to the Piot-Fransen model, the trial in Rakai, which offered treatment of STDs to all subjects irrespective of symptoms (\"mass\" treatment), should have been more effective both in reducing the prevalence of STDs and the incidence of HIV. However, the Rakai trial was stopped because there was no difference in the incidence of HIV between the intervention and control arms. If Mwanza is seen as the trial that needs explaining, another paradigm becomes relevant. In rural East Africa, where all trials have been conducted, networks of concurrent sexual partnerships are a source of infection with both STDs and HIV. Because of their shorter latency periods, STDs may prompt attendance at a clinic before the early signs of HIV-1 infection appear. Part of the management of STDs is to recommend abstinence or the consistent use of condoms until treatment is completed. This recommendation may cover the earliest period of viraemia during primary HIV-1 infection. This paradigm appears to explain the results from Mwanza and Rakai, emphasizing behavioural aspects of syndromic management.\n",
      "Peripheral CD4 T-cell depletion has been observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). To investigate more accurately this alteration, we studied peripheral blood CD45RA(+) and CD29(high) CD4 subsets in 79 TB patients with (HIV(+)TB(+)) or without (HIV(-)TB(+)) HIV infection, 85 HIV-infected patients without TB (HIV(+)TB(-)), and 43 healthy controls, all living in West Africa. The high proportion of CD4(+)CD29(high) T cells observed in controls was dramatically decreased in CDC-A stage HIV(+)TB(-) patients. CD45RA(+) CD4(+) T cells were depleted during the CDC-B stage. Both the percentage and the absolute count of CD29(high)CD4(+) T cells were decreased in HIV(-)TB(+) and HIV(+)TB(+) patients versus controls, but CD45RA(+)CD4(+) T cells were not decreased in TB patients without HIV-infection. Although distinct alterations in the CD4(+) T-cell homeostasis are involved in TB(-) versus HIV-infected subjects, our data suggest that the CD29(+)CD4(+) T-cell depletion observed during the early HIV disease contributes to the risk of active TB, by reducing the pool of T cells able to relocalize to the sites of the M. tuberculosis multiplication.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to determine the use of immune-complex dissociated (ICD) p24 antigen detection for the diagnosis and prognosis of HIV-1 infection in Ugandan children. Plasma collected prospectively from children born to HIV-1 infected Ugandan women was stored and later analyzed for the presence of neutralizable HIV-1 p24 antigen using the Coulter ICD p24 antigen and neutralization kits. HIV-1 infection status, disease progression, and survival of the children were determined. Specimens from 311 children born to HIV-1 infected women, including 138 HIV-1 infected children, and 113 children born to negative women were tested. Sixty-nine (50%) infected children were p24 antigen positive at least once. For early HIV-1 diagnosis, the specificity and positive predictive value of the assay were consistently high (>95% and >83% respectively), but the sensitivity was low (6-53%), especially in the first months of life. The presence of p24 antigenemia in the first two years of life was associated with poor survival (20%) by 80 months of age compared with infected children without antigenemia (43%, P < 0.001). Early detection of p24 antigen (</=2 months) was associated with higher mortality than first detection at an older age (>6 months, P < 0.001). The data suggest that ICD p24 antigen detection is not a sensitive method for the determination of infant HIV-1 status in our cohort of HIV-1 infected Ugandan children tested in the first two years of life. There was a strong correlation, however, between the presence and time of onset of p24 antigenemia and mortality among HIV-1 infected children.\n",
      "HIV-1-specific IgA has been described in the genital tract and plasma of HIV-1 highly exposed, persistently seronegative (HEPS) individuals, and IgA from these sites has been shown to neutralize HIV-1. This study examines the ability of IgA isolated from HEPS individuals to inhibit transcytosis across a tight epithelial cell layer. A Transwell system was established to model HIV-1 infection across the human mucosal epithelium. The apical-basolateral transcytosis of primary HIV-1 isolates across this mucosal model was examined in the presence and the absence of IgA isolated from the genital tract, saliva, and plasma of HEPS individuals enrolled in both a sex worker cohort in Nairobi, Kenya, and a discordant couple cohort in Italy. In the absence of IgA, HIV-1 primary isolates were actively transported across the epithelial membrane and were released on the opposite side of the barrier. These transcytosed HIV-1 particles retained their ability to infect human mononuclear cells. However, IgA purified from the mucosa and plasma of HEPS individuals was able to inhibit HIV-1 transcytosis. Inhibition was seen in three of six cervicovaginal fluid samples, five of 10 saliva samples, and three of six plasma samples against at least one of the two primary HIV-1 isolates tested. IgA from low risk, healthy control subjects had no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transcytosis. The ability of mucosal and plasma IgA to inhibit HIV-1 transcytosis across the mucosal epithelium may represent an important mechanism for protection against the sexual acquisition of HIV-1 infection in HEPS individuals.\n",
      "The occurrence of clinical manifestations associated with primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was evaluated in a prospective cohort study of female sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya. Among 103 women who seroconverted to HIV-1, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, extrainguinal lymphadenopathy, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and vaginal candidiasis were noted significantly more frequently at visits in which seroconversion first became evident. Eighty-one percent of seroconverting women had >/=1 of these 11 symptoms or signs. Among 44% of the women, the acute illness was severe enough to prevent them from working. Having >/=2 of 6 selected symptoms and signs yielded a sensitivity of 51%, specificity of 83%, positive likelihood ratio of 3.2, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.5 for acute HIV-1 infection. The recognition of primary HIV-1-infection illness in high-risk populations and subsequent risk-reduction counseling could potentially reduce secondary HIV-1 transmission during this highly infectious period.\n",
      "During the past few years, definite progress has been made in the field of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccines. Initial attempts using envelope gp120 or gp140 from T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) HIV-1 strains to vaccinate chimpanzees showed that neutralizing antibody-based immune responses were protective against challenge with homologous TCLA virus strains or strains with low replicative capacity, but these neutralizing antibodies remained inactive when tested on primary HIV-1 isolates, casting doubts on the efficacy of gp120-based vaccines in the natural setting. Development of a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine was undertaken in the macaque model using whole live SIV bearing multiple deletions in the nef, vpr and vpx genes. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy against wild-type SIV challenge, but the deletion mutants remain pathogenic, notably in neonate monkeys. Study of the mechanisms of protection in the SIV model unravelled the importance of the T-cell responses, whether in the form of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity, or in that of antiviral factor secretion of cytokines, beta-chemokines and other unidentified antiviral factors by CD8+ T-cells. Induction of such a response is being sought at this time using various live recombinant virus vaccines, either poxvirus or alphavirus vectors or DNA vectors, which can be combined together or with a gp120/gp140 boost in various prime-boost combination strategies. New vectors include attenuated vaccinia virus NYVAC, modified vaccinia strain Ankara (MVA), Semliki Forest virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and Salmonellas. Recent DNA prime-poxvirus boost combination regimens have generated promising protection results against SIV or SIV/HIV (SHIV) challenge in macaque models. Emphasis is also put on the induction of a mucosal immune response, involving both a secretory IgA response and a mucosal CTL response which could constitute a 'first line of defence' in the vaccinated host. Finally, a totally novel vaccine approach based on the use of Tat or Tat and Rev antigens has been shown to induce efficient protection from challenge with pathogenic SIV or SHIV in vaccinated macaques. The only vaccine in phase 3 clinical trials in human volunteers is a gp120-based vaccine, AIDSVAX. A prime-boost combination of a recombinant canarypoxvirus and a subunit gp120 vaccine is in phase 2. Emphasis has been put recently on the necessity of testing prototype vaccines in developing countries using immunogens derived from local virus strains. Trial sites have thus been identified in Kenya, Uganda, Thailand and South Africa where phase I trials have begun or are expected to start presently.\n",
      "Bacterial pneumonia is significantly more common in persons who are HIV-infected than in the general population and is most common among injection drug users and in persons with advanced HIV disease and immunosuppression. The clinical features of bacterial pneumonia are similar to those in HIV-seronegative persons, but bacteremia is more common. When a pathogen is identified, Streptococcus pneumoniae is consistently the most common, occurring in 20% to 70% of cases. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms are mainly responsible for the remainder of bacterial pneumonia episodes in the United States, Central Africa, Australia, and England. In some studies, Chlamydia pneumoniae was recognized as a common cause in persons with early HIV disease, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as a community- and hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract pathogen in patients with severe immunosuppression. Although antimicrobial therapy is frequently empiric, it should be tailored to the severity of illness, local prevalence of infections, resistance patterns, or when an etiologic agent is identified. The treatment response is similar in patients with and without HIV infection, but bacterial pneumonia may accelerate the progression of HIV disease. Preventative measures include use of the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, especially early in the course of HIV infection, when it is most likely to be effective. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is also reduced in HIV-seropositive persons who use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.\n",
      "We have compared the abilities of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope V3 peptides and recombinant gp120 to induce antibodies that neutralize simian/human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs). SHIV-89.6 is a nonpathogenic SHIV that expresses the envelope protein of primary HIV-1 isolate 89.6. SHIV-89.6P, clone KB9, is a pathogenic SHIV variant derived from SHIV-89.6. Infection of rhesus monkeys with these SHIVs rarely induces anti-V3 region antibodies. To determine the availability of the gp120 V3 loop for neutralizing antibody binding on SHIV-89.6 and KB9 virions, we have constructed immunogenic C4-V3 peptides from these SHIVs and induced anti-V3 antibodies in guinea pigs and rhesus monkeys. We found that both SHIV-89.6 and KB9 C4-V3 peptides induced antibodies that neutralized SHIV-89.6 but that only SHIV-KB9 C4-V3 peptide induced antibodies that neutralized SHIV-KB9. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SHIV-KB9 C4-V3 peptide-induced antibodies had a greater ability to bind SHIV-KB9 envelope proteins than did antibodies raised against SHIV-89.6 C4-V3 peptide. We have used a series of mutant HIV-1 envelope constructs to map the gp120 determinants that affect neutralization by anti-V3 antibodies. The residue change at position 305 of arginine (in SHIV-89.6) to glutamic acid (in SHIV-KB9) played a central role in determining the ability of peptide-induced anti-V3 antiserum to neutralize primary isolate SHIVs. Moreover, residue changes in the SHIV-89.6 V1/V2 loops also played roles in regulating the availability of the V3 neutralizing epitope on SHIV-89.6 and -KB9. Thus, SHIV-89.6 and -KB9 V3 region peptides are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies against these primary isolate SHIVs, although the pathogenic SHIV-KB9 is less easily neutralized than its nonpathogenic variant SHIV-89.6. In contrast to natural infection with SHIV-89.6, in which few animals make anti-V3 antibodies, C4-V3 peptides frequently induced anti-V3 antibodies that neutralized primary isolate SHIV strains.\n",
      "HIV-1 group O has its epicenter in Cameroon and neighboring countries and is responsible for 3 to 5% of all HIV infections in this region. It is believed that HIV-1 group O was introduced into the human population by a separate cross-species transmission, occurring independently of the HIV-1 (group M and group N) and HIV-2 transmissions. We have studied the coreceptor requirements of 12 primary HIV-1 O-type isolates from individuals with different clinical symptoms. Only 2 of these 12 viruses showed a syncytium-inducing phenotype after infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and were infectious for the T cell line C8166. These isolates used CXCR4 as a coreceptor for entry, whereas the remaining isolates used only CCR5 efficiently. One isolate was able to use BOB and CCR8 as coreceptors in addition to CXCR4. All group O isolates tested were efficiently inhibited by SDF-1 or RANTES, the natural ligands of CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively. These results indicate that CXCR4 and CCR5 are the principal coreceptors for HIV-1 O-type viruses. Most of the HIV-1 group O isolates studied were derived from patients at later stages of the disease. Although HIV-1 group O and group M infections do not differ in their pathogenesis, the studied isolates did not evolve to use a broad range of coreceptors as described for HIV-1 group M and HIV-2.\n",
      "Eleven patients referred to a hospital in South Africa with suspected tropical diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and South African tick bite fever were found to be suffering from primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Hospital records were reviewed retrospectively in those acutely ill, febrile patients where a clinical suspicion of HIV seroconversion existed and no other diagnosis could be found. A history of recent travel, particularly to malarious areas, was given by most of these patients. The clinical presentation was dominated by high fevers and headaches. The most helpful pointers to primary HIV infection included a characteristic palatal enanthem, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Ironically, the history of recent travel appeared to have confounded the diagnosis despite the fact that travel has often been associated with the acquisition of HIV in Africa. Recognition of primary HIV infection masquerading as a tropical disease may result in more frequent diagnosis of this serious condition.\n",
      "Genetically divergent strains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from macaques (mac), chimpanzees, and sooty mangabeys (SM) efficiently used rhesus and human CCR5 (R5), but not CXCR4 (xR4), for cell entry. Thus far, however, no studies have characterized primary SIVsm strains for their use of coreceptors derived from their own natural host. Coreceptor usage of two primary, blood-derived SIVsm isolates, SIVsmSL92b and SIVsmFNS from naturally infected sooty mangabeys, was determined. Primary SIVsm efficiently used SM-CCR5 expressed on HOS.CD4 and U87.CD4 cells. Sequence polymorphisms in CCR5 found in four sooty mangabeys did not alter viral entry. Unlike primary rhesus blood-derived R5-tropic SIVmac251, primary SM blood-derived R5-tropic SIVsm was strongly CD4 dependent. The SM-CXCR4 gene was fully functional for xR4-tropic primate lentiviruses, but was not used by primary SIVsm. Therefore, the lack of xR4 tropism among naturally occurring SIVsm strains was not due to CxCR4 gene defects in the natural host. SIVmac derived from four macaques with AIDS also did not use macaque- or SM-derived CXCR4, showing that xR4 tropism did not develop during progression to disease as for humans infected with HIV-1. Three of four primary HIV-2 strains used CCR5 from human, sooty mangabey, and macaque. The fourth, HIV-27924A, obtained from a patient with AIDS, was xR4-tropic. Because SIVmac is most closely related to HIV-2, SIVmac might be expected to rnimic tropisms of HIV-2 infections. However, the correlation between xR4 tropism and AIDS may be a species-specific phenomenon limited to humans. The R5-tropic primary SIVsm and HIV-2 strains grew in CCR5-negative human PBMC, consistent with their use of non-CCR5 coreceptors. However, primary SIVsmSL92b did not use non-CCR5 coreceptors efficiently. The two primary SIVsm isolates replicated poorly in CEMx174 cells, which do not express CCR5, compared to CCR5-positive PM1 cells. SIVmac grew equally well in both cell lines. The findings show that SM-chemokine receptors are fully functional for virus entry and that multicoreceptor tropism is a common property of primary lentiviruses within the SIVsm/HIV-2 subfamily.\n",
      "The performance of 14 commercially available HIV-1/2 antibody assays were compared using well-characterized serum panels containing in total 1500 1800 sera. The panels included consecutive HIV-negative blood donor sera from Sweden, unselected blood donor and patient sera from Tanzania and unselected sera from outpatient clinics in Guinea-Bissau. Furthermore selected HIV-1 antibody positive sera from Sweden and Tanzania and HIV-2 antibody positive sera from Guinea-Bissau were included in the panels. The HIV-1 antibody positive sera were from individuals at various stages of HIV infection, from primary infection, to asymptomatic phase and late stage disease. 12 of the 14 assays identified correctly all HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody positive sera. One Tanzanian HIV-1 antibody positive sample with complete banding pattern on Western blot was not detected by two of the ELISAs employing synthetic peptides. There were small differences in sensitivity between the assays when used for analysis of seroconversion panels. The most sensitive assay, Abbott IMx HIV-1/HIV-2 III Plus detected antibodies in all nine samples collected from four individuals during the first week after onset of symptoms of primary HIV-1 infection. Most of the assays became reactive during the second week after onset of symptoms and the least sensitive assays were reactive from the third week. The assays showed a high specificity ranging from 99.2 to 100% when used for analysis of Swedish blood donor sera, while most of the assays showed a significantly lower specificity, 91.9-99.6%, when used for testing African specimens.\n",
      "To compare risk factors for HIV seropositivity with risk factors for HIV seroconversion in a population of volunteer blood donors in Harare, Zimbabwe, and to assess the impact of risk factor exclusion strategies on the safety of the blood supply.\n",
      "A secondary analysis of a longitudinal cohort study was performed.\n",
      "The subjects were volunteer blood donors who were also taking part in a prospective cohort study in Harare, Zimbabwe. They were tested for HIV antibodies upon enrollment and at 6-month intervals. Their donation history, age, marital status and the presence or absence of multiple sex partners and paying for sex were assessed as predictors of HIV seropositivity and HIV seroconversion. The impact of exclusion strategies on blood safety was modeled by estimating the number of HIV-infected units that would escape detection by antibody screening if blood donors with these risk factors were excluded.\n",
      "The HIV seroprevalence among persons accepted for blood donation was 8.8%; the HIV seroincidence was 2.1 per 100 person-years. Significant risk factors for HIV seropositivity were being a new donor (odds ratio 7.3, 95% confidence interval 4.4-1 2.1), age over 25 years (odds ratio 1.6, confidence interval 1.1-2.4), being married (odds ratio 1.7, confidence interval 1.2-2.6), paying for sex (odds ratio 2.6, confidence interval 1.7-3.9) and multiple sex partners (odds ratio 2.1, confidence interval 1.4-2.9). Significant risk factors for HIV seroconversion were age under 25 years (hazard ratio 2.5, confidence interval 1.4-5.0) and being unmarried (hazard ratio 2.5, confidence interval 1.4-5.0). Of note, age and marital status reversed their direction of association with respect to HIV seropositivity and HIV seroconversion. Exclusion strategies based on strong predictors of HIV seroconversion were the most effective in improving the safety of the blood supply.\n",
      "A distinction between risk factors for HIV seropositivity and HIV seroconversion is necessary in order to develop strategies to reduce the residual risk of transfusion-associated HIV transmission. Because window-period donations are the most important source of residual HIV contamination and arise from incident infections, research to develop risk factor exclusion strategies must focus on predictors of HIV seroconversion.\n",
      "Secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort study of voluntary blood donors in Harare, Zimbabwe, confirmed a residual risk of HIV contamination of blood due to laboratory false-negatives and donations made during the window period. It further identified different risk factors for prevalent HIV infection (HIV seropositivity) compared with incident HIV (HIV seroconversion). The HIV prevalence rate among the 1515 blood donors enrolled in the study during 1993-95 was 8.8% (2.1 per 100 person-years). HIV seroprevalence was highest among first-time donors, those 21-45 years of age, married persons, those with more than 1 sexual partner in the preceding year, and those who had paid for sex in the past year. Among the 1142 initially HIV-negative donors who had at least 1 6-month follow-up test, there were 40 seroconversions (2.1 per 100 person-years). Significant risk factors for seroconversion were age under 25 years and single marital status. Since window-period donations account for substantially more HIV contamination of the blood supply than laboratory false-negatives, donor exclusion criteria based on risk factors for incident HIV infection are more likely to reduce the residual risk of HIV contamination than exclusion criteria based on risk factors for prevalent HIV infection.\n",

Women were scheduled for assessment every 2 weeks, and bloods were collected every 6 months for HIV serology, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and CD4 counts. Logistic regression was used to study risk factors for incident genital ulcers.\n",
      "189 women (62.5%) had at least one incident ulcer over 24.3 +/- 15.3 months. GU incidence was higher in seropositive than initially seronegative women (82% vs. 48%; odds ratio [OR]) = 4.33; P < 0.01). Only HIV-1 seropositivity (OR = 3.42), a CD4 count < 200/ml (OR = 1.94), and oral contraceptive use (OR = 1.35) were associated (P < 0.05) with GU incidence in regression analysis. For those ulcers where an etiology was actively sought, Hemophilus ducreyi was confirmed in 54 (19%) of cases, and syphilis in 30 (29%).\n",
      "GU incidence in Kenyan sex workers is independently affected by HIV-1 serostatus, degree of immunosuppression, and oral contraceptive use.\n",
      "Both cross-sectional and prospective studies in Africa have revealed an association between genital ulcer disease (GUD) and HIV-1; it is unclear, however, which of these infections facilitates the other. The epidemiology of GUD was investigated in a prospective cohort study of 302 female sex workers from a slum area in Nairobi, Kenya. At study intake in 1985, 157 women (52%) were HIV-1 seropositive. After a mean follow-up duration of 27.2 months, 36 (25%) initially HIV-negative women seroconverted. 189 women (62.5%) had at least 1 incident ulcer in the follow-up period and a total of 541 new cases were diagnosed. GUD incidence was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (82%) than initially seronegative women (48%). The mean number of new genital ulcerations recorded during the follow-up period was 1.8 (2.7 in initially seropositive women and 1.0 in initially seronegative women). The only significant risk factors for GUD incidence in the regression analyses were HIV-1 seropositivity (odds ratio (OR), 3.42), a CD4 count under 200/ml (OR, 1.94), and oral contraceptive use (OR, 1.35). The significant increase in GUD incidence observed relatively soon after primary HIV infection among the 36 seroconverters strongly suggests that HIV-1 itself plays a causal role in the etiology of genital ulcers. Moreover, the finding that the duration of prostitution was negatively associated with the incidence of ulcers in HIV-negative but not HIV-positive women implies that HIV-1 infection may attenuate the acquisition or retention of effective immune responses against the etiologic agents of GUD.\n",

      "HIV-1 can be transmitted from an infected mother to her infant through breastfeeding, although the precise risk of transmission by this route is unknown. A long-term follow-up of children born to HIV-infected women in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, has enabled us to estimate this risk.\n",

Among children whose PCR results were negative at or before age 6 months, and who were followed up beyond 6 months, an additional four (9%) of the 45 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and two (5%) of the 39 children born to dually seropositive mothers became HIV infected. The estimated rates of late postnatal transmission, with account taken of loss to follow-up and the observed pattern of weaning, were 12% (95% CI 3-23) and 6% (0-14), respectively. One of the five children whose mothers seroconverted from HIV-negative to HIV-1, and one of seven children whose mothers seroconverted from HIV-2 to dual reactivity, became HIV-1 positive. No case of late postnatal transmission occurred in children born to HIV-2-positive or persistently HIV-negative mothers.\n",
      "Breastfed children born to mothers seropositive for HIV-1 alone or seropositive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 in Abidjan are at substantial risk of late postnatal transmission. Early cessation of breastfeeding at 6 months of age should be assessed as a possible intervention to reduce postnatal transmission of HIV.\n",
      "Variation in HIV-1 genomic RNA was studied in seroconversion samples from mother-child pairs from a Rwandan cohort. The mothers (n = 8) were heterosexually infected and their children (n = 6) were vertically infected by breast milk. Five of the children seroconverted within the same 3-month period as did their mothers. Highly homogeneous subtype A V3 and p17gag sequence populations were observed in three mother-child pairs, one of the two nontransmitting mothers, and one child (mean nucleotide distances 0 to 0.9%). Heterogeneous populations of subtype A V3 and p17gag sequences were found in one mother and a mother-child pair (1.4 to 2.8% for V3, 1.0 to 1.9% for p17). The second nontransmitting mother was infected with a heterogeneous AV1-V3/Cp17-p24 recombinant virus population (3. 8% for V3, 2.4% for p17). Finally, in one woman subtype C V3 sequences were observed, in addition to highly homogeneous subtype A V3 and p17gag sequence populations, also found in the child. Coexistence of subtype AV1-V3 and CV1-V3 env sequences in the mother was confirmed in a follow-up sample. The gag gene of both the maternal and the child's virus population represented an A/C recombinant sequence (Ap17/Cp24). An infection with subtype CV1-V3/p17-p24 was found upon testing of three additional participants of the mother-child cohort, indicating that subtype C is present in Rwanda. In conclusion, heterogeneity, coinfection, and intersubtype recombinants are not uncommon in primary HIV-1 infections in Rwanda.\n",
      "HIV-1 and related viruses require co-receptors, in addition to CD4, to infect target cells. The chemokine receptor CCR-5 (ref.1) was recently demonstrated to be a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains, and the orphan receptor LESTR (also called fusin) allows infection by strains adapted for growth in transformed T-cell lines (T-tropic strains). Here we show that a mutant allele of CCR-5 is present at a high frequency in caucasian populations (allele frequency, 0.092), but is absent in black populations from Western and Central Africa and Japanese populations. A 32-base-pair deletion within the coding region results in a frame shift, and generates a non-functional receptor that does not support membrane fusion or infection by macrophage- and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains. In a cohort of HIV-1 infected caucasian subjects, no individual homozygous for the mutation was found, and the frequency of heterozygotes was 35% lower than in the general population. White blood cells from an individual homozygous for the null allele were found to be highly resistant to infection by M-tropic HIV-1 viruses, confirming that CCR-5 is the major co-receptor for primary HIV-1 strains. The lower frequency of heterozygotes in seropositive patients may indicate partial resistance.\n",
      "Both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and African viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) viruses cause similar symptoms in acutely infected individuals and must be included in the differential diagnosis in areas where HIV-1 and VHF viruses both occur.\n",
      "To determine the cause of an acute illness in a patient at risk of exposure to both HIV-1 and African VHF viruses.\n",
      "Serological examination revealed the presence of high levels of the p24 core antigen of HIV-1 in the absence of antibodies to HIV-1 in a specimen collected during the acute stage of the infection. On follow-up, the antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) became negative while the antibody ELISA and confirmatory Western blot for HIV-1 became positive.\n",
      "Acute HIV seroconversion illness may have protean manifestations and, in the more severe forms, may cause diagnostic dilemmas, particularly in regions where African VHFs occur.\n",
      "Networks of concurrent sexual partnerships may be the primary cause of epidemic spread of HIV-1 in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. This pattern of sexual behaviour increases the likelihood that individuals experiencing primary HIV-1 infection transmit the virus to other persons. Networks of concurrent partnerships are likely to be important in both the early ('epidemic') and late ('endemic') phases of HIV-1 transmission. Interventions should aim to break the sexual networks, whatever the stage of the epidemic. However, prevention of transmission in the endemic phase also requires a greater awareness of early clinical manifestations of HIV-1 infection in the general population. Such awareness, coupled with the availability of condoms and access to HIV-1 testing facilities, may reduce transmission in discordant couples.\n",
      "In Africa, the heterosexual spread of HIV-1 may be caused by the high proportion of men and women with more than one regular sexual partner. The primary agent for the spread of the epidemic may have been truck drivers with regular and casual partners at their official and unofficial stops. It is possible that one truck driver could infect every one of his partners on one transcontinental trip. These partners would then infect local men and transmit the virus throughout the countryside, with a declining prevalence occurring at each stage. Most of the female partners of truck drivers are single, but most of the other male partners of these women are married. Transmission risk is enhanced in the presence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the incidence of which is also increased by sexual networks. This wave of transmission will saturate the sexual networks and will then move into a relatively noninfectious asymptomatic phase and cause \"stable\" seroconversion in the rural communities. This will be followed by a wave of deaths among traders, then businessmen, then country people. Thus, interventions to break or partially break the sexual networks are a priority at all stages of the epidemic. Young people must be dissuaded from having sex with older people or with people who have had sex with older partners. Equal-age partnerships could also improve women's status. Ways to break the sexual networks include intervening in the settings where such liaisons occur, especially in the roadside settlements, and maybe in revitalizing marriage. It may also be necessary to promote awareness of the early clinical signs of HIV-1 infection among the population. Controlling STDs may only delay the transmission of HIV in discordant couples, but this, along with the most important changes in sexual behavior and reductions in the sexual networks, provides the most hope for rural Africa.\n",
      "A healthy 19-year-old woman had vaginal intercourse on a single occasion with an HIV-1 positive male from Gambia. Two days later she developed an acute HIV infection presenting as a fulminant multisystem disease that lasted for 35 hospital days and included: immediate immunosuppression with extreme CD4+ lymphocytopenia and combined with CD8+ lymphocytosis, neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia; intermittent spiking fever; pneumonitis; hepatitis; changing skin rashes; peripheral neuropathy with myopathy, and panencephalitis. P24 antigen was detected by Western blot on day 23 and seroconversion was detected by ELISA on day 25. Cultured lymphocytes from peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid grew HIV-1.\n",
      "We set out to document quality of life in South African HIV subjects, using the Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS) SF-36 instrument, and to determine whether this was affected by race, gender or clinical stage of disease. A cross-sectional survey of 134 HIV outpatients (42 White, 49 Mixed race, 43 Black) and 114 healthy non-medical hospital personnel (36 White, 37 Mixed race, 42 Black) was carried out at a referral centre for HIV patients in the Western Cape region of South Africa. Scores on eight scales measuring different aspects of quality of life were calculated. Black female controls scored significantly lower on all scales (p < 0.05) except physical function. HIV-infected subjects of Mixed race (both genders) reported poorer physical function (p < 0.05) but no other scale was affected by race. HIV subjects scored significantly lower than controls on all scales (p < 0.01); the majority of the decline in function occurred early in disease by WHO stages 1 and 2. We conclude that HIV-infection impacts early on all aspects of quality of life and that this impact is largely independent of racial origin.\n",
      "During April 1993 to May 1994, in Cape Town, South Africa, the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-36 was administered in English, Afrikaans, and Xhosa to 114 healthy non-medical hospital personnel aged 20-40 from the three racial groups (White, Mixed race, and Black) working at Somerset Hospital and to HIV patients attending the hospital's HIV clinic. Researchers aimed to examine the quality of life in this HIV population and to determine whether race, gender, or clinical stage of disease affects quality of life. The health concepts addressed in the survey were limitations in physical activities, limitations in social activities, general mental health (psychological distress and well-being), limitations in usual role activities, vitality, and general health perceptions. Black, female, healthy, non-HIV-infected non-medical personnel scored much lower on all scales (p 0.05) except physical function than other groups. HIV-infected persons of mixed race had poorer physical function than the other racial groups (p 0.05). Race affected no other scale. HIV-infected patients scored much lower than the healthy controls on all scales (p 0.01). Most of the decline in physical function took place early in HIV disease (i.e., by World Health Organization stages 1 and 2), when symptoms have not yet appeared. These findings indicate that HIV infection impacts early on all aspects of quality of life and that race-related differences in quality of life do not seem to be important. In conclusion, health workers must not neglect the needs of patients with early HIV disease and must support them at a primary care level.\n",
      "In order to assess the effect of the HIV epidemic on lymph node biopsies in Central Africa, HIV-1 serology was tested on a cohort of patients undergoing node biopsy in Lusaka in 1990, and the histology of all lymph nodes biopsied in Lusaka in 1981 and 1990 was reviewed. One hundred and eighteen lymph nodes were biopsied in 1981 and 351 in 1990. Cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis increased from 52 (31 children and 21 adults) in 1981 to 186 (22 children, 160 adults, four patients unknown age) in 1990. Sixty-eight of 77 adults (88%) with tuberculous lymphadenitis in 1990 tested HIV-positive. Cases of histology suspicious of primary HIV lymphadenopathy and nodal Kaposi's disease also increased. Cases of malignant lymphadenopathy and overall number of surgical biopsies remained equivalent for 1981 and 1990. The study concludes that the HIV epidemic has led to a large increase in diagnostic lymph node biopsies in Lusaka, mostly through an increase in HIV-related adult tuberculous lymphadenitis.\n",
      "The relative importance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphadenopathy amongst patients presenting for lymph node biopsy in Central Africa is unknown. HIV-1 serology and histology of patients undergoing superficial lymph node biopsy during 1989-1990 in Lusaka, Zambia, were examined in a prospective cohort study of HIV serology and by retrospective review of laboratory records. Of 727 lymph nodes biopsied in Lusaka in 1989-1990, 380 (52 per cent) showed tuberculous lymphadenitis, 160 (22 per cent) histology suggestive of primary HIV lymphadenopathy and 66 (9 per cent) nodal Kaposi's disease. HIV serology was tested in 280 adults and was positive in 91 per cent (255 patients), including 89 per cent (153 of 171) of those with tuberculous lymphadenitis, 98 per cent (63 of 64) of those with histology suspicious of primary HIV lymphadenopathy and all (24 of 24) with nodal Kaposi's disease. Other HIV-associated lymphadenopathy included nodal lymphomas and lymphoepithelial cysts. HIV serology was tested in 22 children and was positive in eight, including four of 14 with tuberculous lymphadenitis. It is concluded that HIV-associated lymphadenopathy, especially tuberculous lymphadenitis, is very common amongst patients presenting for lymph node biopsy in Central Africa.\n",
      "Data from a prospective cohort study conducted during 1989-1990 of HIV serology and from a retrospective review of laboratory records of 727 patients presenting for superficial lymph node biopsy at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, were analyzed to determine the relative significance of HIV-associated lymphadenopathy among patients undergoing lymph node biopsy. 380 (52%) of the 727 biopsy patients had tuberculous lymphadenitis (secondary HIV lymphadenopathy). Another 160 (22%) had presumed primary HIV lymphadenopathy. The remaining 66 (9%) had nodal Kaposi's disease. 280 adults were tested for HIV antibodies. 91% tested positive for HIV. The HIV rate was 89% for patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, 98% for suspected primary HIV lymphadenopathy cases, and 100% for those with nodal Kaposi's disease. As for the 22 children 0-16 years old, 8 were HIV positive. 50% of HIV-positive children who underwent lymph node biopsy had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Three had suspected primary HIV lymphadenopathy and 1 had nodal Kaposi's disease. These findings show that HIV-associated lymphadenopathy, particularly tuberculous lymphadenitis, is very prevalent in patients undergoing lymph node biopsy. They stress the importance of investigating further HIV-positive patients with suspicious asymmetrical nodes in central Africa. Simple, appropriate methods (e.g., wide-needle aspiration) are needed for the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis in this region, with its dearth of facilities for surgery and histopathology.\n",

      "Upper zone infiltrate typical of PTB reactivation was present in 18 patients. This pattern was associated with early HIV infection (mean CD4+ T-cell count 389) and had 78% positive predictive value for identifying patients with > 200 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/microL. Pleural effusion was present in 32 patients and occurred over a wide intermediate range of CD4+ T-cell counts (mean 185). Lower or midzone infiltrates, adenopathy, interstitial pattern or normal radiograph occurred in 136 patients and were associated with advanced HIV disease (mean CD4+ T-cell count 105). These patterns had 84%, 89%, 89% and 100% positive predictive value, respectively, for identifying patients with < 200 CD4+ T-cell/microL.\n",

      "Transmission of animal retroviruses has been demonstrated both for oncogenic retroviruses and animal lentiviruses. In humans, breast-feeding is the major route for mother-to-child transmission of Human T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Virus type I (HTLV-I). HTLV-I transmission by breast milk is associated with ingestion of infected cells and can be prevented by formula-feeding. Breast-feeding transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) has only been recently recognized as responsible for one to two thirds of mother-to-child transmission in breast-fed populations. A primary HIV-1 infection acquired in mothers after the baby has begun breast-feeding is associated with a particularly high risk of transmission. Breast milk transmission appears to result from the coexistence of HIV-1 and an inadequate humoral response in milk. Due to the dramatic impact of formula-feeding on child morbidity and mortality, it is suggested that present recommendation continue to promote breast-feeding in women living in settings where infectious diseases and malnutrition are the primary causes of infant deaths, as in many developing countries. On the other hand, in settings where infectious diseases and malnutrition are not the primary causes of infant deaths, as in most of the developed world, mothers with a proven HIV-1 infection should be advised not to breast-feed their babies.\n",
      "The clinical utility of the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition (CCD) of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Africa, several proposed modifications of the WHO CCD, and two proposed screening algorithms for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were examined in adult medical inpatients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined for the CCDs and screening algorithms. Multivariable analysis identified factors with high accuracy for HIV infection. Of 223 patients enrolled in the study, 95 were seropositive for HIV infection. The WHO CCD and the modified CCDs had low sensitivities (14.7-32.6%) but high specificities (95.3-99.2%) and positive predictive values (83.8-94.7%). The screening algorithms had moderate sensitivities (66.3-77.9%) and poor specificities (46.1-79.7%). Multivariable analysis consistently identified oral candidiasis and lymphadenopathy as the best predictors of HIV infection. Although patients with asymptomatic or early HIV infection may be missed by clinical criteria, in a high prevalence population, AIDS may be diagnosed accurately clinically because of the effect of prevalence on the positive predictive values of the CCDs. Furthermore, selection of patients for HIV serologic testing may be guided by simple combinations of clinical features.\n",
      "During April 1994, hundreds of thousands of refugees fled ethnic conflict in Rwanda to enter northern Tanzania. With emergency camps receiving up to 4000 new refugees daily, providing food, clean water, shelter, sanitation, and first aid were priorities. However, overcrowding, boredom, a thriving commercial sex trade, and severe strains upon traditional social structure and family life encouraged high-risk sexual behavior, making camp residents especially vulnerable to HIV infection. Before the exodus of refugees from Rwanda, estimated urban HIV infection rates in the country were as high as 33%. In August 1994, AIDSCAP launched a one-year HIV education and prevention pilot project at Benaco Camp, temporary home to approximately 250,000 refugees. AIDSCAP contracted with CARE, Population Services International, and John Snow Incorporated to implement the project. Such early HIV interventions in a refugee setting had never before been attempted on such a large scale. The text of an interview with a CARE Primary Health Care Unit senior program officer is presented.\n",
      "We have assessed the oligomeric structure and antigenic properties of an affinity purified gp160 protein (oligo-gp160) using biosensor technology. Sucrose gradient purification analysis identified the existence of tetrameric, dimeric and monomeric forms of the protein. Reactivity to a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for oligomeric gp160, discontinuous epitopes within monomeric gp120 and several linear epitopes within gp120 (V3) and gp41 was demonstrated. International sera from several countries, where HIV-1 clades A-F are prevalent, including type O from Cameroon, were reactive with oligo-gp160 indicating conserved antigenic epitopes. Enhanced immunologic reactivity per gp160 molecule was obtained with oligo-gp160 as compared to other current HIV-1(IIIB) subunit monomeric envelope gp120/gp160 immunogens suggesting higher HIV-1 envelope protein mimicry. HIV-1 antibodies from sera during acute HIV-1 infection were detectable by oligo-gp160 prior to detection with either a recombinant, monomeric gp120 protein or several commercial HIV-1 screening kits suggesting antibodies sensitive to oligomeric gp160 structure may be present earlier in infection. The oligomeric nature of this gp160 protein preparation and high reactivity with divergent mAbs and HIV-1 sera support the use of this protein as an HIV-1 immunogen.\n",
      "We compared the cost-effectiveness of three strategies to avert transfusion-associated HIV infection in Zimbabwe: HIV antibody testing, deferral of donors with HIV risk factors, and deferral of donors with risk factors followed by antibody testing (\"Defer/Test\"). The Defer/Test strategy averted the most HIV infections. Compared with antibody testing alone, the Defer/Test strategy, using history of genital ulcer or any sexually transmitted disease as a criterion for deferral, resulted in net savings. The cost per HIV-infected unit averted using history of paying for sex or having had multiple sex partners was $ 127 and $ 773, respectively. We discern four benefits of risk factor-based deferral before antibody testing. First, deferring donors at risk lessens collection of blood in the window period. Second, deferring donors likely to be HIV positive minimizes the number of units discarded. Third, ascertainment of donor risk provides an opportunity for AIDS education and prevention. Fourth, the number of false negatives is lower with a lower HIV prevalence among accepted donors. The Defer/Test strategy is cost-effective in Zimbabwe because additional recruitment costs are offset by discarding fewer HIV-positive units. We predict the Defer/Test strategy will be cost-effective in other sub-Saharan African donor populations.\n",
      "A crucial requirement in the rational design of a prophylactic vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is to establish whether or not protective immunity can occur following natural infection. The immune response to HIV infection is characterized by very vigorous HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity. We have identified four HIV-1 and HIV-2 cross-reactive peptide epitopes, presented to CTL from HIV-infected Gambians by HLA-B35 (the most common Gambian class I HLA molecule). These peptides were used to elicit HIV-specific CTLs from three out of six repeatedly exposed but HIV-seronegative female prostitutes with HLA-B35. These women remain seronegative with no evidence of HIV infection by polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. Their CTL activity may represent protective immunity against HIV infection.\n",
      "A crucial requirement in the rational design of a prophylactic vaccine against HIV is to establish whether or not protective immunity can occur following natural infection. The immune response to HIV infection is characterized by very vigorous HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Four HIV-1 and HIV-2 cross-reactive peptide epitopes were identified, presented to CTL from HIV-infected Gambian women by HLA-B35 (the most common Gambian class 1 HLA molecule). The study population consisted of 20 women: 14 had been prostitutes for more than 5 years and reported little condom usage and 6 were long-term sexual partners of HIV-infected men. Peptide-stimulated cultures were also set up from 8 known seropositive donors with HLA-B35 or B53, and from a control group of volunteers at low-risk of HIV infection with HLA-B35 (12 Gambian and 7 European) and 2 Gambians with HLA-B53. Specific CTL activity against one or more peptides was repeatedly detected after 10-14 days in the peptide-stimulated cultures from 3 of the 6 high-risk seronegative women with HLA-B35, but not in their three counterparts with HLA-B53 nor in any of the low-risk volunteers. The strongest responses were generated toward the HIV-1 pol peptide, which lies close to the active site of reverse transcriptase, and to the nef peptide, which is conserved between HIV-1 and -2. HIV-specific CTL in seronegative subjects could potentially be a response to acute HIV infection, before the development of antibodies, but the women were still seronegative and virus-culture negative 3 months after the CTL were first detected, making recent infection extremely unlikely. These women remain seronegative with no evidence of HIV infection by polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. Their CTL activity may represent protective immunity against HIV infection.\n",
      "Despite the ongoing review of donor recruitment criteria by local blood transfusion services and the development of highly sensitive and specific testing for the presence of antibodies to HIV in blood and blood products, there remains a residue of HIV in donated blood. This is because of donors who are in the 'window period' between acquisition of HIV and seroconversion, human errors and limits to the sensitivity and specificity of current tests. Data available from a national survey of HIV seroprevalence in South African blood donors allowed for the estimation of the number of units screened negative but likely to be infected with HIV. Assuming window periods of 4.8 and 14 weeks, a test sensitivity of 99.9%, a specificity of 98.5% and a human error rate of 0.1%, the likely rate of HIV-infected blood in the South African blood transfusion supply ranges from 1.1 to 3.9/100,000 units, with a likely estimate of 2.2/100,000 units. In the current South African blood transfusion setting, between 8.1 and 28.2 units of blood per annum will be HIV-positive with a likely estimate of 15.9 units. This corresponds to an odds ratio of between 1:90 909 and 1:25 641 units infected with HIV. These data are comparable with the risk in developed countries. The expected increase in the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection in all adult South African populations necessitates additional measures to ensure a blood supply which is as safe as possible. Some of these measures have already been taken by local blood transfusion services.\n",

Tuberculous lymphadenitis was falsely suspected in four patients, as was reactive follicular hyperplasia in four, and Kaposi's disease in four.\n",
      "Wide needle aspiration cytology is useful in the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in Central Africa, with the exception of lymphadenopathic Kaposi's disease.\n",
      "There are considerable data suggesting that breast milk and colostrum transmit HIV. The European Collaborative Study shows the risk of transmission of HIV from breast milk to infant to be about 28%. A study in Rwanda indicates that transmission is more likely to take place during viremia which occurs during primary HIV infection and later with progression to AIDS. Postnatal transmission in this study stood at about 60%. Breast feeding protects against diarrhea and respiratory infections. A study in Brazil demonstrates that infants who were not breast fed were at 14.2 and 3.6 higher risk of death from diarrhea and respiratory infections, respectively, than breast-fed infants. These risks are especially great where poverty, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene predominate. A study in Malaysia shows that infants living in a household with no piped water and no toilet and were not breast-fed faced a 5-fold risk of death after 1 week of age than breast-fed infants living under the same conditions. This risk continued to be high (2.5) for non-breast-fed infants living in a household with piped water and a toilet. In developed countries, affordable formula, clean water, and adequate facilities for sterilizing bottles allows HIV positive mothers to bottle feed their infants which should reduce the vertical transmission rate. In developing countries, however, bottle feeding is expensive and hazardous. Governments often cannot provide potable water and sanitation services. In addition, mathematical models demonstrate that for HIV positive mothers, the risk of infant death is lower in infants who breast feed than in those who do not. Thus, in those areas of the world where infectious diseases and malnutrition are the leading causes of infant death, health workers should promote breast feeding regardless of HIV status of the mothers.\n",
      "During a sero-survey for lymphotropic retroviruses, seven screening tests were performed for the three lymphotropic retroviruses of relevance in Djibouti, East Africa (HIV-1, HIV-2 and HTLV-1). Of the 82 subjects whose sera reacted in at least one retroviral screening assay, about one third could be followed, and their sera were re-examined after a 5-month interval, and then after an additional 3-month interval. Six selected individuals are reported here, whose retroviral serologies presented important and often unexplained changes over an eight-month period. The six cases summarize prototypic situations and present serological results in a style appropriate to stimulate thought on the significance and interpretation of lymphotropic viral serologies. Each case study is followed by a set of questions that formulate pertinent serological concepts.\n",
      "A total of 600 sera were collected in the city of Djibouti during a national HIV survey in June 1988 from individuals at high risk for acquiring HIV-1. 7 screening tests were performed for antibodies to the 3 lymphotropic retroviruses HIV-1, HIV-2, and HTLV-1. 82 subjects' sera reacted in at least 1 retroviral screening assay. Sequential serological test outcomes are presented for the 6 cases whose retroviral serologies after a 5-month interval in November 1988, and after an additional 3-month interval in February 1989 presented often unexplained changes. Each case study is followed by a set of questions amounting to 26 diagnostic problems. During the follow-ups, a 10 ml venous blood sample of the 6 subjects was used to separate and process mononuclear cells for phenotypic analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Western Blot testing for the 3 retroviruses was performed on patients' plasma. A neutralization enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect circulating HIV antigen in sera was also performed on all samples. Case 1 was a false positive HIV-1 screening assay in a 22-year old unmarried heterosexual male with a sexually transmitted disease. The patient's serum tested negative by 6 tests, but positive by the ELAVIA, which gave 1 nonrepeatable reactive result for HIV-1. PCR analysis was strongly positive, despite the still indeterminate profile of the Western Blot. The assay that gave 1 single (false?) positive result was perhaps the only assay that detected an early HIV-1 infection, or the PCR result may have been false positive. Case 2 was a triple sero-conversion and co-infection in a female prostitute with an indeterminate HIV-1 Western Blot. Case 2 was another prostitute, with HIV Western Blot sero-progression or sero-repression. Case 4 was a delayed Western Blot sero-conversion in a female with an early positive HTLV-1 screening test. Cases 5 and 6 were 2 female prostitutes with antibodies against either envelope or polymerase antigens alone. The dilemma is what the physician should tell the person with a question ale lymphotropic serology.\n",

      "The focus of infection with HIV is the lymphatic system, resulting in a specific HIV-related pathology in the parotid. Of the salivary glands, the parotid gland is unusual in including lymphoid tissue within its capsule. Infection by HIV is accompanied by a characteristic follicular hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue which can be recognized histologically as primary HIV lymphadenopathy and presents clinically as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Subsequent opportunistic infections and HIV-related neoplasia can result in secondary HIV lymphadenopathy. Parotid lymph nodes reflect these HIV-related changes. Diffuse enlargement of the parotid glands are further manifestations of HIV infection. All patients who presented to a general surgical unit of the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, over the 2-year period of 1989-1991 were studied in a prospective clinicopathological study of lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of HIV infection was made clinically and with a single serological test. Parotid lymphadenopathy was present in 69 of 261 HIV-seropositive patients with generalized lymphadenopathy who underwent lymph node biopsy during the 2-year period. In all but one patient, biopsy of a node other than the parotid provided the histological diagnosis. 9 patients presented with bilateral parotid enlargement. 8 of the patients had generalized lymphadenopathy caused by primary HIV lymphadenopathy in 5, Kaposi's disease in 2 and tuberculous lymphadenitis in 1. 4 patients presented with multiple cystic parotid lesions of between 1 month and 4 years duration. Unilateral extraparotid lymphoepithelial cysts of a diameter of 2 and 3 cm were removed from the jugulodigastric area of 2 patients with generalized lymphadenopathy. Parotid disease not related to HIV included: 1 case each of papillary carcinoma and pleomorphic adenoma; 7 patients with parotid lymph nodes, and 3 patients with diffuse bilateral parotid enlargement.\n",
      "Numerous studies have suggested that there are significant differences in replication capacities and cytopathicities among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates and that these differences correlate with the clinical status and geographical origin of infected individuals. However, it has been difficult to assess whether reported distinctions could be attributed to the methods used or whether they imply a true disparity between viral isolates. We thus attempted to characterize the replication properties of HIV-1 isolates directly recovered from infected patients (primary isolates) by using a standardized infection assay. Viruses were isolated from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by a single coculture with normal donor PBMC stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Replication curves and cytopathic effect of a standard inoculum (1 ng of p24) of 66 primary HIV-1 isolates were similar regardless of clinical stage of the patient (asymptomatic, AIDS-related complex, or AIDS) and evolutive feature (rate of progression to AIDS). There was no difference between viruses derived from patients sensitive to zidovudine and those derived from patients resistant to zidovudine. Moreover, no difference was found among viral isolates of different geographical origins (Central Africa, Zaire, Brazil, or France). Similarly, the replication patterns and cytopathicities of isolates from bronchoalveolar lymphocytes did not differ from those of isolates derived from PBMC. In contrast, the same amount of viral inoculum of five laboratory HIV-1 strains (HIV-1, EL1, SF, MN, and RF) produced different replication curves and were much less cytopathic. In contrast to laboratory viral strains, it appears that the primary HIV-1 isolates tested, whatever their clinical status and source, exhibited similar replication capacities and cytopathicities in allogeneic donor PBMC.\n",
      "Between April and December 1989, 32 consecutive patients referred to the neurology clinic with acute peripheral facial paralysis were studied. Patients with traumatic facial palsy, parotid gland disease, otitis media and meningitis were excluded. Each of the patients selected had HIV test done by ELISA and the positive ones confirmed by Western blot. 8 (25%) of the patients tested positive for HIV antibodies. Their mean age was 34 +/- 13 years with an age range of 15-53 years. 4 (50%) of the 8 seropositive patients had generalized lymphadenopathy, one herpes zoster, one generalized pruritic rash, two of the patients were asymptomatic. The seroprevalence of HIV antibodies in patients with acute peripheral facial paralysis is much lower than that reported in other African countries.\n",
      "Between April-December 1989, physicians at the neurology clinic of the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya recruited 32 patients who exhibited facial nerve palsy of lower motor neuron type and who did not have any trauma, inflammation of the middle ear, surgery, or disease of the parotid gland. 8 (25%) of the patients were HIV seropositive. Researchers did not retest any of the seronegative patients for HIV. 6 of the HIV seropositive cases had symptoms of early HIV infection: 4 generalized lymphadenopathy, 1 herpes zoster, and 1 generalized pruritic rash. The 2 other HIV seropositive patients did not have any symptoms other than facial paralysis. Several other studies have demonstrated an association between HIV infection and acute peripheral facial paralysis, especially in asymptomatic or AIDS related complex patients. In a study in Bangui, Central African Republic, HIV seroprevalence among patients with acute peripheral facial paralysis was 69%. The researchers could not identify the reason for the difference between the HIV seroprevalences of the 2 studies. Nevertheless physicians should expect to treat more cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis as the prevalence of HIV increases.\n",
      "The significance of understanding the vertical transmission of HIV lies in the 78% of women's AIDS cases (1991) of sexually active women who may transmit the infection to their offspring. 2% of children in the US and 5-25% of children in developing countries are HIV infected. The current rates of maternal-fetal transmission average 25-30%. Interrupting this mode of passage would provide protection for children. The Van de Perre study on postnatal transmission by breast feeding is discussed in order to the timing of HIV infection and the relationship to infant risk of infection. Postnatal infection of infants suggests that the risk is enhanced during the primary infection of the mother. It is pointed out that transient but large elevations in plasma virus titers have been observed during primary infection of homosexual men, before anti-p24 and anti-gp160 antibodies appear. These plasma titers may increase the efficiency of vertical transmission. It is also possible that the absence of neutralizing or nonneutralizing antibodies may enhance transmission. The frequency of new infections is estimated by Van de Perre in the rate of seroconversion in Rwandan women as 4.7-7.3%/year. The US rate is .6-.8/1000/year for all adults and adolescents. Pregnancy can occur after primary HIV infection or at the onset when plasma titers are high and antibody levels are low. It is reported that the rate of transmission may be highest when mothers are in a more advanced disease state. Another factor affecting transmission is the presence or absence of maternal antibodies. Lower HIV transmission may be related to the presence of epitopes on the hypervariable V3 loop of HIV gp120 or the principal neutralizing domain. Although HIV virus has been identified in fetal tissues after 8-15 weeks gestation, there is reason to believe that the greatest transmission is intrapartum because maternal blood may be ingested or there is maternal-fetal transfusion during labor and delivery. New York studies have suggested that 50% of infected infants of known seropositive women will be positive by the polymerase chain reaction by 3 months of age and 50% by 3-6 months of age. It is likely that the delay is due to infection late in gestation.\n",
      "A patient is described in whom an acute human immunodeficiency virus seroconversion illness occurred following a trip to southern Africa. The presentation was strikingly similar to that of African tick typhus and could only be distinguished by serological testing.\n",
      "Physicians admitted a 27-year-old man to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, England because he had had a fever for 2 days (39 degrees Celsius) and a generalized erythematous maculo-papular rash for 1 day. These symptoms appeared soon after returning from a 5-month visit to Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Much of his visit included visits to rural areas where insects bit him frequently. He experienced vaginal intercourse with some women, but did use condoms each time. He had his last sexual experience 10 days before becoming ill. When the physicians examined the patient, they noted many small palatal ulcers, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, and a 5 mm diameter nontender ulcer of the glans penis. At this point, they believed he suffered from tick typhus and primary syphilis. Laboratory tests showed 29% of his white blood cells to be lymphocytes and Treponema pallidum in the penile ulcer exudate. The physicians then prescribed daily intramuscular injections of 600 mg procaine penicillin for 10 days. The rash vanished 2 days and the fever and ulcers vanished 5 days after treatment began. Blood tests later done while still in the hospital revealed him to be HIV-I p24 antigen positive, but anti-HIV-I and -II negative. 2 months later, however, he tested HIV-I positive, but negative for rickettsiae, arboviruses, cytomegalovirus, and enteroviruses. Since he later tested HIV positive and negative for pathogens causing typhus, it was concluded that his typhuslike illness was a result of acute HIV seroconversion. Other physicians have also noted similar manifestations of seroconversion in HIV positive patients. They recommended that physicians should consider HIV seroconversion illness when a patient who recently traveled to the tropics or is sexually active exhibits an acute febrile condition with maculo-papular rash.\n",
      "We reviewed the published data on the possible impact of medical injections and blood transfusions on the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Africa. We also compared these results to our experience in Rwanda, central Africa. The importance of medical injections in the epidemic of HIV infection seems to differ from one area to another. The excess of injections experienced by HIV seropositive subjects in Zaire could be secondary to the parenteral treatment of early HIV-related illness or to the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, rather than being the cause of HIV infection, as suggested by Rwandese studies. In contrast, blood transfusions have been shown to represent an important source of nosocomial HIV infection in many African countries. Effective and relatively inexpensive measures to diminish the iatrogenic spread of HIV infection in developing countries are summarized.\n",
      "Published data on the significance for spread of HIV of medical injections and blood transfusions in Zaire are reviewed and compared to a survey of nosocomial links to HIV infections in health workers, factory workers and children in Kigali, Rwanda. The Rwandan survey subjects included 156 health workers at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, 76 children with AIDS or ARC diagnosed at the same hospital, and 302 male factory workers. Medical injections are slightly more common in HIV positive than negative subjects in 3 reports from Zaire. Injections were not linked to HIV-positive status in Rwanda, unless the individual had been treated for STDs (p0.01), or febrile illness (p0.01). The trend in hospitalized children, who had often received penicillin, quinine or vaccines, suggested that treatments of other conditions, not HIV-related illness, most often transmitted HIV. In urban factory workers, positive HIV status was associated only with infections for treatment of STDs. In children from Zaire, transfusion was strikingly associated with HIV seropositivity. In hospital workers and children from Rwanda, blood transfusions were associated with positive HIV status. It is unlikely that most developing countries in Africa will be able to secure the blood supply by universal testing for HIV, nor will they be able to afford single use syringes. It is possible, however, to improve hospital hygiene by boiling or bleaching equipment, to promote use of oral instead of parenteral drugs, and to improve safety of the blood supply by testing donors, recruiting donors from low risk groups, and using unpaid donors.\n",
      "Three children are described in whom pre-transfusion samples were HIV-seronegative and post-transfusional samples, obtained within 1 week after transfusion, were HIV-seropositive. Two of them developed a transient fever within 1 week of receiving the blood transfusion, and a transient generalized skin eruption which lasted for about 2 weeks. All three developed persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. One child developed a lumbar herpes zoster 7 months after transfusion. IgM Western blots demonstrated the presence of antibodies to protein bands p17, p24 and p55 in all three children. These three case reports suggest that children who receive a seropositive blood transfusion are at high risk for developing acute manifestations of HIV infection.\n",
      "Systematic efforts are needed to prepare persons newly diagnosed with acute or chronic HIV infection to cope. We examined how patients dealt with this news, looking at how readiness to accept an HIV diagnosis impacted treatment outcomes, prevention of transmission, and HIV status disclosure. We examined vulnerability and agency over time and considered implications for policy and practice. A qualitative sub-study was embedded in the Tambua Mapema (“Discover Early”) Plus (TMP) study (NCT03508908), conducted in coastal Kenya between 2017 and 2020, which was a stepped wedge trial to evaluate an opt-out HIV-1 nucleic acid testing intervention diagnosing acute and chronic HIV infections. Diagnosed participants were offered antiretroviral therapy (ART), viral load monitoring, HIV partner notification services, and provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to their uninfected partners. Data were analyzed using thematic approaches. Participants included 24 individuals who completed interviews at four time points (2 weeks and 3, 6, and 9 months after diagnosis), including 18 patients (11 women and 7 men) and 6 partners (1 woman, 5 men, of whom 4 men started PrEP). Acceptance of HIV status was often a long, individualized, and complex process, whereby participants’ coping strategies affected day-to-day issues and health over time. Relationship status strongly impacted coping. In some instances, couples supported each other, but in others, couples separated. Four main themes impacted participants’ sense of agency: acceptance of diagnosis and commitment to ART; positive feedback after attaining viral load suppression; recognition of partner supportive role and focus on sustained healthcare support whereby religious meaning was often key to successful transition. To support patients with acute or newly diagnosed chronic HIV, healthcare and social systems must be more responsive to the needs of the individual, while also improving quality of care, strengthening continuity of care across facilities, and promoting community support.\n"
